the SAS \\nDeployment Manager, and the User’s Guide \\nWhat is the SAS Deployment Wizard? \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard is the common interface used to install and deploy all SAS 9.4 software. \\nUsing the SAS Deployment Wizard, you can create and interact with the SAS Software Depot, the \\nrepository of files and data necessary to install your SAS 9.4 software. When the SAS Deployment \\nWizard is exercised to its full capability, it provides a broad range of deployment opportunities, from \\ninstalling software on a single machine to installing on many machines across several tiers, either \\nsilently or interactively. \\nWhat is the SAS Deployment Manager? \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager is a tool that looks very much like the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nHowever, the SAS Deployment Manager is used for post-installation configuration tasks such as \\nconfiguring some products, applying hot fixes, updating metadata, and uninstalling SAS software.  \\nUsing this Guide \\nThis User\\'s Guide is a high-level document providing support information for the SAS Deployment \\nWizard and its processes. It is our expectation that this document, combined with the Help \\ninformation available from each SAS Deployment Wizard dialog, should be sufficient information to \\nassist you to install and deploy your software. However, if you need more technical information or \\nwould like to see detailed screen-by-screen instructions, SAS has created the SAS 9.4 Intelligence \\nPlatform: Installation and Configuration Guide, available at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/94administration. As always, if you cannot find the answers to \\nyour questions, SAS Technical Support is available to assist you. \\nDefinition of Terms \\nThis section defines terms key to installing and deploying your SAS software. \\nSoftware Order Email \\nThe Software Order Email contains important information about your SAS Software Package and \\ninstructions for preparing to install your software. The Software Order Email is sent to the SAS \\nInstallation Representative at your site.  \\nIf you cannot find your Software Order Email, you should go to the web site \\nhttp://support.sas.com/adminservices-SID to have it re-sent to the SAS Installation \\nRepresentative at your site. \\nSAS Software Depot \\nThe SAS Software Depot is a centralized disk copy of your installation media. The SAS Deployment \\nWizard can invoke a process that will automatically create a SAS Software Depot from any SAS 9.4 \\ninstallation media you might have.  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n2 \\nSAS Installation Data file (SID file) \\nThe SAS Installation Data file consists of customized installation information and product \\nauthorization information. The SAS Deployment Wizard uses the installation information in the SID \\nfile to install your licensed software and apply customized product authorization information to your \\nsystem. The file is named something like sas94_xxxxxx_yyyyyyyy_zzz.txt, where xxxxxx is \\nyour order number, yyyyyyyy is your setnumid (also sometimes referred to as “site number,” a \\nunique identifier that Tech Support uses), and zzz is the operating system the order is licensed for. \\nThe SID file for your software (order) will be located in the sid_files directory at the root of your \\nSAS Software Depot or, if you have received media, on the first disk of that installation media. \\nSAS Order Information \\nThe SAS Order Information is a file that contains the list of SAS software that you have ordered. This \\nlist is the same as the one that is included with your Software Order Email, but is included in your \\nsoftware. The SAS Order Information file is located in your SAS Software Depot at \\n/install_doc/<order number>/soi.html. \\n\"Basic\" and \"Planning\" \\nYour Software Order Email and SAS Order Information have a field described as \"Order Type\" or \\n“Deployment Type”. The value in the field will be either \"Basic\" or \"Planning.\" Basic orders are \\ngenerally straightforward single-machine deployments. Planning orders are more complex, multi-\\nmachine deployments. The type of order you have helps you to identify your orders (if you have \\nmore than one order) and determines the path you use to go through the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nSASHOME \\nSASHOME is the file location where your SAS software is installed on a machine (for example, the \\ndefault SASHOME for Windows is C:\\\\Program Files\\\\SASHome). SASHOME is determined when \\nyou install software through the SAS Deployment Wizard the first time, and that location will \\nbecome the default installation location for any other SAS software you install on the same machine. \\nFor Windows users, this means that you will only be prompted for the SASHOME location the first \\ntime you use the SAS Deployment Wizard on a machine. \\nNote: The location you use for SASHOME must not contain a SAS Software Depot. \\n \\nIf you would like to install more than one version of SAS on a machine, you can do so by using a \\ndifferent SASHOME for each version. If you are putting planned deployments of different versions of \\nSAS on the same machine, you will also have to ensure that you are using different configuration \\ndirectories. You should also ensure that there are no port conflicts between the two versions, \\nespecially if you intend to run both versions at the same time. Furthermore, Windows users can only \\nregister file types to a single version. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n3 \\nDeployment Plan \\nMost installations of Basic orders will not require a deployment plan. A deployment plan is a pre-\\nselection of the software that will be installed by the SAS Deployment Wizard. It contains a \\ndescription of what the plan deploys, identifies the target machines, and lists the software to be \\ninstalled and configured. It is an XML file and is named plan.xml. \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard contains a set of standard deployment plans that may be used with \\nlittle customization. If you are working with a SAS consultant in the deployment of your software, \\nthat consultant has access to a tool to create a customized deployment plan for your installation.  \\nIf you perform a planned deployment, a copy of the deployment plan that was used is stored in the \\nconfiguration directory in the plan.<year-month-day-hour-minute>.xml format. For example: \\n   C:\\\\SAS\\\\Config\\\\Lev1\\\\Utilities\\\\plan.2011-01-24-02.24.xml \\nNote about Large Fonts \\nIf you are running the SAS Deployment Wizard or SAS Deployment Manager on a computer using \\nlarger fonts or a higher DPI setting, some of the pages may be truncated in the viewable area of the \\napplication. You can improve this by enlarging the size of the application when it first opens. \\nNote about Running Simultaneously with SAS Download Manager \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard writes to many of the same files as the SAS Download Manager. \\nTherefore, instances of the SAS Deployment Wizard and the SAS Download Manager cannot be run \\nat the same time.  \\nNote about Deployment Registry \\nIn order to support updates to the SAS software, installation data is stored in a deployment registry \\ncreated in your SASHOME directory and located under <SASHOME>\\\\deploymntreg. This registry \\nshould not be moved, modified, or deleted in any way while you have SAS software installed in \\norder to ensure successful application of updates. The registry should only be deleted if you are \\nperforming a complete removal of all SAS software from the machine. \\nNote about UNIX Installer Account \\nFor UNIX, the installer account must be the sas account with a umask of 022. The root account should \\nnot be used since it will cause deployment failures. \\nMany organizations increasingly avoid the use of shared user accounts to ensure that their IT \\ndepartments can track and report which people are using and modifying the hardware and software \\nservices. The UNIX installer account is frequently targeted as the subject of such audit control. \\nHowever, for many SAS deployments, a group of system administrators may know how to log into \\nthe environment using the UNIX installer account, making it difficult to look at the normal logs and \\ndetermine who is acting as that account for a given action. \\nIn order to facilitate audit control, you can establish a procedure that prohibits anyone from logging \\nonto the UNIX installer account directly. The following steps describe this process for a system \\nadministrator. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n4 \\nNote:  The following steps require sudo. Not all organizations have sudo, or sudo may be rigorously protected \\nsince it uses root privileges. Check with your system administrator before attempting to use sudo. \\nNote:  If you decide to use this procedure, you must not use it for deploying the metadata tier of any planned \\ndeployments. The SAS Metadata Server always requires the sas account in order to configure. After \\nthe metadata tier has been deployed, you can use this procedure on all other machines in the \\ndeployment. \\n1. Log on with your personal credentials. \\n2. Submit the su - sas command to allow you to operate as the UNIX installer account. This \\nexample assumes the user ID is “sas”, which is the recommended user ID. If you use another \\nuser ID, use it in place of sas in the command. \\n3. Modify or update the SAS software. \\n4. Log out of the su identity and return to your own shell. \\nNote for Windows Terminal Server Users \\nIf you are using a Windows terminal server, you must use the same account for every installation on \\nthe terminal server and for any subsequent updates to the terminal server. \\nNote about UNIX Windowing Environments \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has a graphical user interface by default. If you are installing your \\nsoftware on a UNIX system, make sure that a windowing environment—such as X11—is installed. If \\nyou would prefer to use a text interface on UNIX, refer to the “Using a Text-Based Interface” section \\nin Chapter 3, “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” or in Chapter 7, “SAS Deployment \\nManager: Command Line Options”. \\nNote about Federal Desktop Core Configuration  \\nIf you are using Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) security standards on your system, do \\nnot use the autologin functionality when the SAS Deployment Wizard is performing updates and a \\nreboot is required. \\n \\nPage 5 \\n \\nChapter 2 — Best Practices \\nThis chapter contains suggestions about how best to use the SAS Deployment Wizard and SAS \\nSoftware Depot. \\nUsing Defaults \\nAs you use the SAS Deployment Wizard, SAS recommends that you accept the defaults provided to \\nyou throughout the dialogs. As long as the SAS Deployment Wizard remains open, you can go back \\nthrough the dialogs to see and change your entries. Use the Help button to get more information \\nabout what the defaults are for individual pages. \\nIf you do change any initial defaults, your responses become the defaults for each subsequent pass \\nwith the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nThe SAS Software Depot \\nThe SAS Software Depot is a centralized disk copy of your installation media. A depot may contain \\nmultiple orders with the following restrictions:  \\n• \\nOrders from 9.4M0 through 9.4M7 can exist in the same depot. \\n• \\nOrders from 9.4M8 and later can exist in the same depot. \\n• \\nOrders from 9.4M8 and later cannot exist in the same depot as orders from 9.4M7 and earlier. \\nDirectory Structure \\nThe SAS Software Depot has a common directory structure across all orders. The following is a \\ndescription of the directories at the root of each SAS Software Depot and their contents. SAS strongly \\nrecommends not changing the directory structure in any way manually, instead using the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard for any directory manipulation that may be required. \\nThere are only a few subdirectories that you should ever have to interact with: \\n• \\nsid_files – This is the subdirectory that contains the SAS Installation Data file (SID file) for \\nyour order or orders. The SAS Deployment Wizard will ask for the location of your SID file \\nduring the install process and will point to this directory by default. When you receive a new SID \\nfile upon renewing your software, usually annually, you should store it in the sid_files \\ndirectory as well. Tech Support recommends not deleting your original SID file. \\n• \\nthird_party – This subdirectory contains any third-party software required for your order that \\nSAS can provide, as well as the documentation for installing it. The QuickStart Guide for your \\norder will direct you to the appropriate point in the installation process to install the third-party \\nsoftware. \\n• \\nstandalone_installs – This subdirectory contains SAS software that must be installed \\noutside the SAS Deployment Wizard. Instructions for installing this software are available either \\nin the ReadmeFiles subdirectory described below or in installation instructions described by \\nthe preinstallation checklist, if one is available for the products. \\n• \\ninstall_doc – This subdirectory is divided into smaller subdirectories based on your orders. \\nEach order subdirectory contains a Software Order Information file and an \\nordersummary.html, which is the full list of the products contained in your order. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n6 \\nIf your order includes a third_party or standalone_installs subdirectory, the readme \\ndocuments describing how to install software in those subdirectories will be available in the \\n/install_doc/<order number>/ReadmeFiles folder. \\nCreating Media from SAS Software Depots \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has a process by which you can create media from an existing SAS \\nSoftware Depot. This process can only duplicate what was in the original order, since it is what is \\ndescribed in the order’s data. Adding files, such as renewal SID files, to the SAS Software Depot will \\nnot result in their automatically being included in the automated duplication process since such \\nmanual movement is not recorded into the order data. Note that this process will not actually create \\nthe media, but prepare images that you should burn for yourself, using whatever media burning \\nsoftware you have installed. Use the following steps to copy your SAS software to media: \\n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \\norder, and at the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software \\nDepot and click Next.  \\n2. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the software order you want to copy \\nand click Create Media-Ready Image…. \\n3. The Create Media page opens. In the Media Type field, select the type of media want to \\ncreate. In the Target Directory field, enter the location where the media-ready images will be \\ncreated. You can use the Browse… button to find an appropriate directory. Click Start to \\nbegin creating the media-ready images. \\n4. When the SAS Deployment Wizard has finished creating the images, close the Create Media \\ndialog and click Finish on the SAS Software Depot.  \\n5. Go to the target directory you selected in step 3. The SAS Deployment Wizard has created a \\ndirectory structure consisting of a labels.txt file and at least one subdirectory. The \\nlabels.txt file contains a list of the created subdirectories and names for them as well as \\ninformation about those names. It will also list any additional steps that may be required \\nbased on your specific software order. \\nFind as many pieces of media as there are subdirectories in your target directory. Label each \\npiece of media according to the labels.txt file.  \\n6. Using your media burning software, burn the contents of each subdirectory onto the \\ncorrespondingly labeled media.  \\nNote: \\nDo not burn the subdirectory itself on to the media, but open it and burn its contents onto the \\nmedia. Use of the media you make relies on some of the files being at the top of the media. \\nBurning the subdirectory inserts an extra directory level on the media that will hamper its \\nuse. \\nNote on Hot Fixes and Media Creation \\nAny hot fixes in the order that you are burning to media will not be included in this process. To \\nretrieve the latest hot fixes for the software in the order, create a SAS Software Depot from the media \\nyou just created and start the SAS Deployment Wizard.  At the Select Deployment Task page, select \\nManage this SAS Software Depot and then select Retrieve Hot Fixes on the Manage SAS Software \\nDepot page in order to find and download the latest hot fixes. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n7 \\nNote on Media Burning \\nDuring the development and testing of the SAS Deployment Wizard, SAS discovered inconsistencies \\nbetween media-burning applications, sometimes resulting in unexpected errors. Note, however, that \\nthe SAS software, including the SAS Deployment Wizard, was not the cause of the errors. Instead, the \\nerrors occurred as a result of failures in the burning process or as a result of different specifications \\nbetween the drives burning the media and the drives reading the media. \\nTry to use the exact same type of drive for burning and reading the media you create. If you use a \\ndifferent drive to read the media, unexpected errors like installation hangs and messages about \\ncorrupted files may occur. Testing has shown that, in every case, corruptions that occur are a result of \\nthe burning process and that the hangs are a result of the reader not being able to read the burned \\nmedia. Please note, though, even using the same type of drive is not a guarantee that the errors will \\nnot occur; it just makes them less likely. Also ensure the media creation software you use preserves \\nthe directory and file names used in the media target directory structure; that is, it does not truncate \\npathname components. \\nNote also that much of the burning software is operating system-specific. If you intend to use your \\nburned media on a different operating system than the one used to create it, ensure that your burning \\nsoftware is capable of supporting that operating system. \\nFinally, the quality of the media affects the quality of the burning process. Using lower quality media \\nusually results in fewer successful attempts to burn and read that media. \\nMoving SAS Software Depots \\nIf you decide to move or copy your SAS Software Depot from the location where it was originally \\nbuilt, the method you use depends on the network status of the original and target locations.  \\nMoving Between Shared Networked Locations \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard allows you to copy a SAS Software Depot from an existing one by \\nchoosing the Create or Add to a SAS Software Depot at the opening Select Deployment Task page. \\nIf you choose to use the Create or Add to a SAS Software Depot option, the SAS Deployment \\nWizard also allows you to subset orders within the SAS Software Depot being copied so that you can \\ncreate smaller depots in new locations. The Help information for the Select Deployment Task page \\nand the subsequent pages describe the subsetting process. \\nMoving Between Non-Shared Network Locations \\nIf you are moving a SAS Software Depot between locations that are not networked, SAS has created \\nthe SAS Software Depot Copy Utility for Windows and UNIX that uses FTP processes in order to \\nmove a depot.  \\nNote:  The SAS Software Copy Utility for UNIX uses FTP libraries. If you only have SFTP enabled on your \\nUNIX machine, you can use the media creation process to copy a depot, described below.  \\nSAS Software Depot Copy Utility \\nThe SAS Software Depot Copy Utility copies an entire depot and places it in a target that you \\ndescribe. You cannot subset your software depot using the Copy Utility. \\nThe SAS Software Copy Depot Utility is located in the \\\\utilities\\\\depotcopier directory of \\nyour SAS Software Depot. Windows users should double-click SASDepotCopierUtility.exe \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n8 \\nwhile UNIX users should execute SASDepotCopierUtility.sh. The Command Prompt window \\nwill open for Windows users, while UNIX users will see the questions in their xterm window. \\nNote:  If you are working from a depot that was created by subsetting another depot, the utilities \\ndirectory will not exist. \\n1. The Copy Utility asks you to enter the host name of the remote machine that you want to \\ncopy the software depot to. Type the location for the copy of your software depot and press \\nENTER. \\n2. The Copy Utility asks for the user ID for the machine you are copying to. Type the user ID \\nand press ENTER. \\n3. The Copy Utility asks for the password for the user ID you described in the step above. Type \\nthat password and press ENTER. For security reasons, you will not see your password as you \\ntype it. \\n4. The Copy Utility asks for the location of the software depot on the machine you are working \\nfrom. Type the location and press ENTER. \\n5. The Copy Utility asks for the location on the remote machine where you want to place the \\ncopied software depot. Type that location and press ENTER. When you press ENTER, the \\ncopying process begins. \\nNote:  The location that you select must already exist. The utility cannot create a new directory. \\n6. When the copying process is complete, you will receive a success message. Windows users \\ncan close their Command Prompt window. \\nNote: \\nIf you are copying the depot from a Windows environment to a UNIX environment, the appropriate \\nexecute permissions will need to be set manually. After the copy process is complete, issue the \\nfollowing command: \\nchmod –R 755 <depot location> \\nUsing the Media Creation Process (UNIX only) \\nIf your UNIX system only has SFTP enabled, you should use the media creation process described \\nabove to help with that task. It is important that whatever tool you use to move/copy the depot will \\nnot affect the case of any files and that it will not truncate long filenames to 8.3 format. \\n1. Perform the steps described in the \"Creating Media from SAS Software Depots\" section \\nabove.  \\n2. Take your media to the machine you wish to install the SAS Software Depot on. Insert the \\nfirst piece of media, and select the executable that corresponds to the operating system of the \\nmachine to start the SAS Deployment Wizard (for example, Windows users should use the \\nsetup.exe file). If you are working from a single piece of media, at the opening Select \\nDeployment Task dialog, select Create a SAS Software Depot and click Next. Follow the \\ninstructions in the SAS Deployment Wizard to move your software from the media to the \\nnew location. \\nIf you have more than one piece of media, the SAS Deployment Wizard will automatically \\nbegin with the dialogs to create a SAS Software Depot. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n9 \\nDeleting SAS Software Depots \\nSAS strongly recommends not removing SAS Software Depots. When you keep your SAS 9.4 depot, \\napplying maintenance and upgrades become easier because you only need to download the changed \\ndepot files instead of having to download an entire SAS order again. \\nFor space reasons, you may want to remove a SAS Software Depot after your software has been \\ninstalled. If you decide to remove a SAS Software Depot, SAS strongly recommends that you make a \\nbackup of your SAS Software Depot on media so that you will have a copy of the installation files \\nshould they be required. You can create media by using the process described the \"Creating Media \\nfrom SAS Software Depots\" section above. \\nNote that if you remove the SAS Software Depot without making a copy of it, you have also removed \\nthe SAS Deployment Wizard and the files necessary to make it run. \\nDeleting Software Orders from SAS Software Depots \\nNote:  When you are deleting software orders, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \\nTo remove an order from a SAS Software Depot: \\n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \\norder.  \\n2. At the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software Depot \\nand click Next.  \\n3. The Manage SAS Software Depots page opens. Select Manage SAS Software Depot and \\nclick Next. \\n4. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the software order you want to delete \\nin the Select a SAS Software Order pane, then click Delete Order. \\n5. The Confirm Order Delete window opens, asking if you are sure you want to delete the \\norder. Click Yes. \\n6. The Delete Order window opens indicating that the work is being done. When the window \\ncloses, the order is no longer present in the Select a SAS Software Order window. \\nChanging Software Order Details in SAS Software Depots \\nTo change the information associated with a software order in the SAS Deployment Wizard: \\n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \\norder.  \\n2. At the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software Depot \\nand click Next.  \\n3. The Manage SAS Software Depots page opens. Select Manage SAS Software Depot and \\nclick Next. \\n4. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the order for which you want to revise \\nthe information, then click the Change Details button. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n10 \\n5. The Order Details window opens. In the Description field, you can modify the description \\nof the order that shows when the order is listed. In the Notes field, you can add information \\nthat will help you with using the order in the future. After those fields contain the \\ninformation you want included, click OK.  \\n6. If you changed the description, the Order Description will change in the Manage SAS \\nSoftware Depot page. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nManaging Your SID Files \\nAs noted above, there really are only two rules of thumb for managing your SID files. First, use the \\ndefault location for storing your SID files or keep an accurate record of where you store your SID \\nfiles. Second, ensure that subsequent SID files that you receive are kept in the same location. Storing \\nyour SID files in the sid_files subdirectory described above meets both of these objectives.  \\nUsers who have an enterprise-wide deployment should also consider having their SID files in a \\nnetworked location in order to ensure that all users have access to them. \\nStoring and Using Deployment Plan Files \\nBy default, any deployment plan files shipped with your software will be stored in the plan_files \\ndirectory at the root of your SAS Software Depot. If you receive or create a customized deployment \\nplan file, you should also store it in the plan_files directory. In order to differentiate between \\ndeployment plan files, you can either create a new directory for each plan.xml file inside the \\nplan_files directory or simply add a prefix (for example, entbiserver.plan.xml). If you do \\nadd a prefix, ensure that the end of the file name does not change from \"plan.xml.\"    \\nNote:  \\nIf you are deploying your software using a plan.xml file and it indicates more than one deployment \\nstep on the same machine, each deployment step on that machine after the first one should be performed \\nwith only the Configure SAS Software option selected (leaving the Install SAS Software option \\nunselected) on the Select Deployment Type page.  \\nAfter your SAS software is installed, your deployment plan files are no longer strictly necessary, but \\nyou may want to keep them on hand for record-keeping purposes, for possible future re-installation \\nand re-configuration tasks, or for the addition of products. \\n \\nPage 11 \\n \\nChapter 3 — SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options \\nNote that the command line options in this chapter apply to all installations, including initial \\ninstallation, add-on installations, and installing maintenance on an existing deployment. \\nQuiet Installation \\nA quiet installation allows you to provide all of the responses that would normally be supplied to the \\nwizard when running interactively, but without the presence of a user. It is intended for use in any \\ncontext that does not require a user to be present at the machine.  \\nIn order to perform a quiet installation, you should first create a response file according to the \\n\"Record Mode\" section of \"Record and Playback\" below. After you have created a response file, you \\nshould use the information in the \"Quiet Playback Mode\" section below to perform the quiet \\ninstallation on the target machine. \\nWindows users should also consider the \"Restarting\" command line options in the following section \\nfor use with any reboots that may occur. \\nThe MIF File in Quiet Mode (Windows only) \\nThe Management Information File (MIF file) is created during Quiet Mode to allow you to determine \\nthe success or failure of either the System Requirements Wizard or SAS Setup. This file contains \\ninformation typically used by Microsoft SCCM, but usable by any process that determines the success \\nor failure of an installation. \\nThe MIF file is always written to the Temp directory, and is named sas.mif by default. The MIF file \\ncontains a series of START and END sections, which define certain attributes related to the tool\\'s \\nexecution. Of specific interest to determine the success or failure of the tool is the section called \\n“InstallStatus,” similar to the following: \\nSTART GROUP \\n   NAME = \"InstallStatus\" \\n    ID = 2 \\n    CLASS = \"MICROSOFT|JOBSTATUS|1.0\" \\n    START ATTRIBUTE \\n      NAME = \"Status\" \\n      ID = 1 \\n      ACCESS = READ-ONLY \\n      STORAGE = SPECIFIC \\n      TYPE = STRING(32) \\n      VALUE = \"Success\" \\n    END ATTRIBUTE \\n    START ATTRIBUTE \\n      NAME = \"Description\" \\n      ID = 2 \\n      ACCESS = READ-ONLY \\n      STORAGE = SPECIFIC \\n      TYPE = STRING(255) \\n      VALUE = \"Installation Successful.\" \\n    END ATTRIBUTE \\n  END GROUP   \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n12 \\nThe Status and Description fields, along with their corresponding values, provide information on the \\nresults of the installation. In this example, the installation was successful, as indicated by the bold \\nitems above. For a failure, the fields above might be set as follows: \\nNAME = \"Status\" \\nVALUE = \"Failed\" \\nNAME = \"Description\" \\nVALUE = \"Installation aborted by the user.\" \\nIf the MIF file indicates success, then there is no need to be concerned with the log file. If the MIF file \\nindicates that the installation failed, and you feel more troubleshooting is necessary, you will need to \\nreview the log file. \\nRecord and Playback \\nRecord and playback is a feature in the SAS Deployment Wizard that is used to save dialog responses \\nto a file and then load those responses at a later point. The SAS Deployment Wizard provides three \\ndifferent modes for record and playback. Each mode is described in detail below. \\nNote that using any of the command line options in the \"Record and Playback\" section while \\ncreating/managing a SAS Software Depot is not supported. \\nRecord Mode \\nNote:  Response files may contain passwords in plain or encrypted format. You should secure response files as \\nyou would any other sensitive information. \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, by default, every time that the SAS Deployment Wizard is \\nrun it creates a response file that contains values for each of the prompts the user sees when running \\nthe SAS Deployment Wizard. This file is named ResponseRecord_<timestamp>.log and is \\nlocated in the same directory as the SAS Deployment Wizard log files: \\nWindows \\n%USERPROFILE%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\SAS\\\\SASDeploymentWizard\\\\ \\nUNIX \\n$HOME/.SASAppData/SASDeploymentWizard/   \\nYou can also run the SAS Deployment Wizard in record mode to force the SAS Deployment Wizard \\nto create a second response file. The SAS Deployment Wizard must run to completion when creating \\nthe response file in this mode. \\nNote:  If you record a deployment that includes products that require interaction from the user, your response \\nfile will not record those manual responses. Therefore a response file created in this fashion will be \\ninsufficient for use with any method of playback (quiet or interactive).  \\nUsage \\n‐record \\nA second, non-default response file will be created in the user’s home directory on all platforms with \\na file name of sdwresponse.properties. If you want to specify the location of the non-default \\nresponse file, use the ‐responsefile command line argument.  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n13 \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file being created>\" \\nNote:  If you specify a file location where a file already exists, the pre-existing file will be overwritten by the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard. \\nIn addition, you can use the ‐inputresponsefile command line option to use another response \\nfile as a source for creating a new response file. See the examples below. \\n‐inputresponsefile \"<full path to the response file being read>\" \\nBy default, no deployment occurs when running in record mode. In order to force a deployment \\nwhile recording, use ‐deploy. \\nNote:  If you use both the ‐record and ‐deploy options, you will be recording an installation on a specific \\nmachine. Therefore, the response file that is created may not be appropriate for use on other machines. \\nSAS recommends response files created using the two options simultaneously only be used on other \\nmachines with caution. More specifically, if a response file is created on a machine with one version of \\nInternet Protocol (IPv4/IPv6) and that file is used on a machine with a different Internet Protocol, the \\ndeployment will fail. \\nResponse files should only be used for software in the same software order. Using a response file \\nfrom one order while deploying a second order may result in unintended discrepancies that are \\ndifficult to troubleshoot. \\nFinally, if you use any other command line options while using ‐record, those options are not \\nincluded in the response file. To properly use the response file, you must repeat those same \\ncommand line options with the playback. \\nExamples \\nIn each example, if a file with the specified name is already in the specified location, the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard will overwrite the existing file with a new one. You will not be warned that you \\nare overwriting a file. \\nsetup.exe ‐record \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will record a response file named sdwresponse.properties \\nand store it in your home directory. \\nsetup.exe ‐record ‐deploy \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will deploy your software and record a response file named \\nsdwresponse.properties that will be stored in your home directory. \\nsetup.exe ‐record ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\foobar.properties\" \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will record a response file named foobar.properties and store \\nit at C:\\\\foobar.properties.  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n14 \\nsetup.exe ‐record ‐inputresponsefile \"C:\\\\foobar.properties\" \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will read the responses in C:\\\\foobar.properties and use them \\nto seed the default responses as it records a new response file. The new response file will be \\nnamed sdwresponse.properties and will be stored in your home directory. \\nsetup.exe ‐record ‐responsefile “C:\\\\mylogs\\\\ResponseFile.properties”  \\n‐inputresponsefile \"C:\\\\foobar.properties\" \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will read the responses in C:\\\\foobar.properties and use them \\nto seed the default responses as it records a new response file. The new response file will be \\nlocated at C:\\\\mylogs\\\\ResponseFile.properties. \\nQuiet Playback Mode \\nUsers can suppress the user interface for the SAS Deployment Wizard by running in this mode. The \\nmode requires an existing response file. If the SAS Deployment Wizard encounters a dialog for which \\nthere is not a valid response in the response file, a message will be recorded in the log file and the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard will return an error code of -1. There is no visual feedback while the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard is running in this mode. SAS recommends that you check your log file after the \\ninstallation to determine if any errors occurred. \\nThe location of the log files is described in the \"SAS Deployment Wizard Log Files\" section below.  \\nNote:  If the SAS Deployment Wizard is forced to reboot your machine in order to install required software, \\nwhen the SAS Deployment Wizard restarts, it will no longer be in quiet playback mode. \\nUsage \\n‐quiet \\nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user’s home directory on all platforms \\nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties. \\nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\n \\nNote: \\nBecause the response file created automatically by the SAS Deployment Wizard does not contain \\nvalues for the passwords, SAS strongly recommends using the ‐quiet command line option only \\nwith a response file that has been created using the ‐responsefile command line option described \\nabove. \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nNote on Windows Usage \\nWindows users also have the ‐wait option available for their use. The -wait option forces the \\nsetup.exe process to remain in the task list until the SAS Deployment Wizard completes, which is \\nimportant with any provisioning software such as Microsoft\\'s SCCM or IBM\\'s Tivoli. The following is \\nan example using the ‐wait option: \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n15 \\nsetup.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nPartial Prompting \\nWhen running the SAS Deployment Wizard in partial prompt mode, the user only sees dialogs that \\ndo not have a valid response in the response file. This mode is used when the SAS Deployment \\nWizard resumes after being interrupted by a reboot and values originally supplied are no longer \\nvalid. This can occur when mapped drives are lost after rebooting on Windows. This mode may also \\nbe used by administrators to supply some of the deployment information for their users.  \\nUsage  \\n‐partialprompt  \\nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user\\'s home directory on all platforms \\nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties.  \\nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument:  \\n‐responsefile <full path to the response file>  \\nExample  \\nsetup.exe ‐partialprompt ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\"  \\nMonitoring the SAS Deployment Wizard during Quiet Playback \\nRunning the SAS Deployment Wizard in quiet mode makes it more difficult to monitor the \\ninstallation and to notice if errors occur. To address this concern, you can use ‐quietstatus option \\non Windows and periodically issue the ps command on UNIX and z/OS to track whether the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard is running. \\nWindows \\nOn Windows, specify the ‐quietstatus option when invoking the SAS Deployment Wizard in \\nquiet mode to display a small status dialog to help identify when the deployment is complete. In \\naddition, you can add ‐minimize in order to force the status dialog to open in a minimized state. \\nUsage \\n‐quietstatus ‐minimize \\nExample  \\nsetup.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" ‐quietstatus \\n‐minimize \\nUNIX and z/OS \\nAs with most processes on UNIX and z/OS, issue the ps command to monitor the SAS Deployment \\nWizard running in quiet mode. Remember that output from a ps command can be misleading \\nbecause the process name returned is not always named setup.sh, since the actual script that the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard is running at any given time varies. However, the process ID remains the \\nsame. \\nFor example, if you were to run the SAS Deployment Wizard and immediately issue a ps command \\n(before the language dialog box would be displayed), you would see output similar to \\n31762 pts/2 S 0:00 /bin/sh /depot/setup.sh \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n16 \\nNote that the shell, /bin/sh, runs the initial script, /depot/setup.sh. The shell is the parent \\nprocess, and in this example has a process ID of 31762. When setup.sh is finished executing, it \\npasses control to the script, deploywiz.sh. If you were to look at the process list while the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard is running, you would see something similar to the following in a process list: \\n31762 pts/2 S 0:00 /bin/sh \\n/tmp/_setup31762/products/deploywiz__9220__prt__xx__sp0__1/deploywiz.sh \\n‐startuplocation /depot \\n‐templocation /tmp/_setup31762 \\nThe shell /bin/sh is still running and retains the same process ID. However, this shell is running a \\ndifferent script now, deploywiz.sh. \\nInteractive Playback Mode \\nThe response file can also be used to default all the prompts in the SAS Deployment Wizard. In this \\nmode, all the dialogs in the SAS Deployment Wizard are displayed and the default values are loaded \\nfrom the response file. \\nNote:  Even if you are using ‐responsefile to install your software on a UNIX system, you must still \\ninstall a windowing environment, such as X11. Using ‐responsefile still invokes a graphical user \\ninterface.  \\nUsage \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nLogging \\nYou can use the command line to specify the level of detail you would like to use in the log files for \\nyour deployment. There are three levels of logging: \\n• \\nlog level 0 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to its lowest detail, \\nproviding only cursory information about the deployment. \\n• \\nlog level 1 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to its default detail, verbose \\nmode. \\n• \\nlog level 2 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to is highest level, debug \\nmode. \\nUsage \\n‐loglevel <value between 0 and 2> \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐loglevel 2 \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n17 \\nHot Fixes \\nFor more information about the hot fix process, see the “Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” chapter. \\nExcluding Hot Fixes \\nIf you would prefer not to install the hot fixes in your order, you should use the ‐nohotfix \\ncommand line when you start the SAS Deployment Wizard.  \\nNote:  Using the ‐nohotfix option prevents you from receiving automatic security updates that are \\nincluded in your software order. To find and install those security fixes, go to \\nhttps://tshf.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/SAS_Security_Update\\ns.html. \\nUsage \\n‐nohotfix \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐nohotfix \\nIncluding Hot Fixes (z/OS only) \\nIf you want to allow hot fixes in your order to be installed during later installations of software in \\naddition to your original order, you should use the ‐hotfixupdate command line option. This \\ncommand line creates an exception to the rule that hot fixes included with an order can only be \\ninstalled in a clean SASHOME. \\nUsage \\n‐hotfixupdate \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐hotfixupdate \\nChecking System Requirements (Windows only) \\nBeginning with release SAS 9.4 TS1M1 Rev. 940_14w11, the SAS Deployment Wizard enables you to \\ncheck your Windows order to determine what system requirements need to be met before you can \\nuse SAS software. This system requirements check is usually performed during a normal deployment \\nbut is immediately followed by the installation of the requirements and then the SAS software. Using \\nthe ‐srwonly command line option allows you the choice of installing only the system requirements \\nor not installing anything at all but instead creating a batch file that can be used on different \\nmachines throughout your deployment. \\nNote:  The batch file that is created should only be used on machines that are running the same version of \\nWindows and which will have the same SAS products installed on them. \\nUsage \\n‐srwonly \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐srwonly \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n18 \\nProcedure \\nUse the following steps to check your Windows machine for system requirements: \\n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard with the ‐srwonly command line option: \\nsetup.exe ‐srwonly \\n2. The Choose Language page opens. Choose the language in which you want to run the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard. Click OK. \\n3. The Select System Requirements Task page opens. Select Install System Requisites Now in \\norder to perform the check and then install the requisite software or select List System \\nRequirements to Install Later in order to create a batch file for later use on this or any other \\nmachine using the same Windows version. After you have made your selection, click Next to \\ncontinue. \\n4. If you are performing a planned deployment, the Select Deployment Type page opens. (If \\nyou are performing a basic deployment, skip to step 6.) Select Perform a Planned \\nDeployment if you want to use a plan to filter the products you would like to check. (Note \\nthat you cannot select Configure SAS Software since you have indicated by using the \\ncommand line that you only wish to check the system requirements). If you do not want to \\nuse a filter, select Install SAS Foundation and Related Software. \\nWhen you have made your selection, click Next to continue. \\n5. If you selected Perform a Planned Deployment in the previous step, the Specify \\nDeployment Plan page opens. (If you selected Install SAS Foundation and Related \\nSoftware, go to step 6.) Select Specify the full path to a customized deployment plan if you \\nhave a plan that has been provided to you by consultants or other SAS representative. If you \\nselect this option, you must also enter the location of the deployment plan in the field or use \\nBrowse to search for it. If you do not have a custom deployment plan, you must use the \\nSelect a standard deployment plan option. If you choose this option, you can scroll through \\nthe list of available standard plans or use Search to find a plan based on words in the plan \\nname. \\nWhen you have selected the plan you want to use, click Next to continue. \\n6. The Select Products to Install page opens, listing all the products in the software order you \\nare working with. If you are using a basic deployment, ensure that SAS Foundation and \\nrelated software is selected from the Products to install list. If you are using a planned \\ndeployment, select the machine for which you want to check system requirements. \\nScroll through the list of products and select the ones for which you want to check the system \\nrequirements. You can use Select All to choose every product and Clear All to remove the \\nselection from every product. When the correct products are selected, click Next to continue. \\n7. If you selected SAS Foundation in step 6, the Select SAS Foundation Products page opens (if \\nyou did not select SAS Foundation, skip to step 8). Select the SAS Foundation products for \\nwhich you want to check the system requirements. You can use Select All to choose every \\nproduct and Clear All to remove the selection from every product. When the correct \\nproducts are selected, click Next to continue. \\n8. The Select Language Support page opens. Because different languages have differing \\nrequirements, you must select the language or languages for which you want to check the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n19 \\nsystem requirements. You can use Select All to choose every language and Clear All to \\nremove the selection from every language. When the correct languages are selected, click \\nNext to continue. \\n9. The Select Regional Settings page opens. Because different regional settings have differing \\nrequirements, you must indicate the setting for which you want to check the system \\nrequirements. If you want the machine to support several languages that cannot be included \\nwith a single encoding, select Configure as a Unicode server in order to force the software to \\nuse the UTF-8 encoding for all cases. When you have made your selection, click Next to \\ncontinue. \\n10. The Required System Requisites to Install page opens, listing the requisite software for the \\nproducts you selected in steps 6 and 7. Click Next to continue. \\n11. If the products selected in steps 6 and 7 did not require use of all the system requirements \\nassociated with all the products in the order, the Optional System Requisites to Install page \\nopens. (If the Optional System Requisites to Install page does not open, skip to step 12). \\nThis page lists additional system requirements for those products not selected in order that \\nyou can choose to check them also. Select the requisites for which you want to check. You can \\nuse Select All to choose every requisite and Clear All to remove the selection from every \\nrequisite. When the correct requisites are selected, click Next to continue. \\n12. The Checking System window opens, indicating that the SAS Deployment Wizard is \\nscanning your machine to ensure it has enough space to install the requisite products you \\nselected in steps 10 and 11. Usually, the space required is nominal, so you should have an \\nempty lower pane when the scan is complete. Click Next to continue. \\n13. The Deployment Summary windows opens, listing the requisite software you have chosen \\nto install or add to the batch file, depending on your selection in step #3. Click Start to initiate \\nthe action. \\n14. A progress page opens, indicating success or failure for each product being installed. When \\nthe installation is complete the Deployment Complete window opens, listing the software \\nthat the SAS Deployment Wizard attempted to install and the results or the requisite \\nsoftware to be added to the batch file, depending on your selection in step 3. \\n• \\nIf you selected Install System Requisites Now in step 3, the window describes the \\ninstallation status of the requisite software. A green icon indicates that the requisite was \\ninstalled successfully. A yellow icon means that the requisite was not needed for any of \\nthe products that you selected because of the operating system on which the machine is \\nrunning and the language and encoding choices you made previously. A red icon means \\nthat the requisite installed but with errors. A blue icon indicates that the requisite was \\nnot needed because it had already been installed on the machine. \\n• \\nIf you selected List System Requirements to Install Later in step 3, the window \\ndescribes the status of adding the requisites to the batch file. A green icon means that the \\nrequisite was added to the batch file successfully. A yellow icon indicates that the \\nrequisite was not needed for any of the products that you selected because of the \\noperating system on which the machine is running and the language and encoding \\nchoices you made previously. A red icon means that an error occurred when adding the \\nrequisite to the batch file. \\nAfter reviewing the page, click Next to continue. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n20 \\n15. The Additional Resources page opens, listing documentation that can help with your \\ndeployment. If you chose to create a batch file rather than installing the requisites, the \\nAdditional Resources page also lists the location of the batch file you created, under “SAS \\nSystem Requisite Batch File”. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nIf a batch file was created, that file contains the order number for which the system requirements \\ncheck was performed, the Windows operating system for the machine, and the products that were \\nused to check against. The batch file can be used on other machines than the one where the check was \\nperformed, but it should only be used with the same order and the same selected products on the \\nsame Windows operating system. \\nConfiguring the SAS Deployment Agent \\nThe SAS Deployment Agent is a new tool in SAS 9.4 used to support configuration operations \\nassociated with multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. SAS products can \\ncommunicate with the SAS Deployment Agent in order to run remote processes and copy content \\nover the SAS Deployment Agent connection to perform configuration management operations. \\nConfiguring the SAS Deployment Agent consists of assigning a port for remote communication and \\nmaking security specifications. \\n The SAS Deployment Wizard also has two new command lines associated with this configuration. \\nSkipping Configuration \\nUse ‐skipagentcfg in order to install the SAS Deployment Agent but skip all configuration steps \\nfor it. The configuration steps should be performed later using the SAS Deployment Manager (see the \\n“Manage SAS Deployment Agent Service” section in chapter 6 below). \\nUsage \\n‐skipagentcfg \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐skipagentcfg \\nForcing Configuration \\nUse ‐forceagentcfg in order to override any already installed SAS Deployment Agent and \\nrespond again to the dialogs in order to overwrite any existing properties. However, using ‐\\nforceagentcfg will not force the credentials to be regenerated. Regenerating credentials can only \\nbe performed through the SAS Deployment Manager configuration task (see the “Manage SAS \\nDeployment Agent Service” section in chapter 6 below). \\nNote:  The SAS Deployment Agent pages are install-time only. If you do not choose the install path at the \\nSelect Deployment Type page, you will not see the SAS Deployment Agent dialogs. \\nUsage \\n‐forceagentcfg \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐forceagentcfg \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n21 \\nMiscellaneous \\nSpecifying a Different SASHOME (Windows only) \\nWhen you first use the SAS Deployment Wizard on Windows, you are asked to specify the location \\nwhere you would like to have your SAS software installed, referred to as SASHOME. The location \\nyou enter that first time is then used as the default for all subsequent usage. If you would like to use a \\ndifferent location for SASHOME than the default, use the ‐changesashome command to force the \\nSASHOME dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard. The SAS Deployment Wizard will then use this \\nnew SASHOME as the default. \\nNote:  Windows only allows one active SASHOME. If an already defined SASHOME contains active SAS \\nsoftware and you want that SAS software to remain active, then -changesashome should not be \\nused. More than one SASHOME for the same SAS release is not supported on Windows. \\nUsage \\n‐changesashome \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐changesashome \\nConfiguring a Host Name \\nNote: This SAS Deployment Wizard option is new with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_20w26. \\nIf you are performing an update or upgrade, the SAS Deployment Wizard must be run on the same \\nhost that the original configuration was performed on. Over time, that host name might be changed, \\nresulting in errors when an update is attempted. Using the -confighostname option allows you to \\nchange the local host name that the SAS Deployment Wizard validates against to the value in the \\noption. \\nUsage \\n‐confighostname <host name> \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐confighostname hostname.companyname.com \\nUsing a Text-Based Interface (UNIX only) \\nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on z/OS. \\nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Wizard in \\nconsole mode, allowing for the use of a headless system.  \\nNote:  Console mode cannot be used with physical media; that is, you cannot use console mode to create a \\nsoftware depot from DVDs. However, you can use console mode to install your software from any \\ndepot, including one that is created from physical media. \\nIf you use console mode, each dialog used in the installation of your SAS software is represented in \\ntext, as in the following example: \\nSelect a language in which to view the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n22 \\n  \\n( ) 1 - German  \\n(*) 2 - English  \\n( ) 3 - Spanish (Castillian)  \\n( ) 4 - French  \\n( ) 5 - Italian  \\n( ) 6 - Japanese  \\n( ) 7 - Korean  \\n( ) 8 - Chinese Traditional  \\n( ) 9 - Chinese Simplified  \\n \\nThe * character indicates the current selection.  \\nYou can change the selection by specifying a number below.  \\nEnter <q> to quit.  \\nPress Enter to accept the current selection and continue.  \\nSelection: \\nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \\nquit” above, you must include those symbols. \\nThe ‐console  command line option can be used with other options at the same time, such as \\nrecording or playing back a response file. \\nNote:    If you intend to run the SAS Deployment Wizard in console mode to perform a deployment without a \\ngraphical display, ensure that the DISPLAY environment variable is unset, as opposed to it being set \\nto a blank value (that is, DISPLAY= ). \\nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output of \\nthe SAS Deployment Wizard. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display before \\npausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a line \\nbefore wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with any \\nother command line option. \\nUsage \\n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \\nExample \\nsetup.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \\nSpecifying a Graphic Interface (z/OS only) \\nBy default, the SAS Deployment Wizard uses console mode when running on a z/OS machine. If you \\nare deploying your software on z/OS and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command line \\noption to use the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n23 \\nUsage \\n‐x11 \\nExample \\nsetup.rexx ‐x11 \\nAutomatically Submitting Jobs (z/OS only) \\nBy default, z/OS users must manually submit jobs. The ‐jobsubmit command line option allows \\nthe SAS Deployment Wizard to automatically submit jobs. \\nUsage \\n‐jobsubmit \\nExample \\nsetup.rexx ‐jobsubmit \\nUnchaining Install Jobs (z/OS only) \\nBy default, SAS install jobs are chained. To force each job to be submitted manually, use the  \\n‐nojobchain option. The ‐nojobchain option is ignored if ‐jobsubmit is specified. \\nUsage \\n‐nojobchain \\nExample \\nsetup.rexx ‐nojobchain \\nTurn Off Pre-Installation Validation (z/OS only) \\nBy default, SAS validates data set allocation parameters for z/OS (high-level qualifier, SMS classes, \\ndisk unit, disk volume, and temp unit) before the installation begins.  To turn off the pre-installation \\nvalidation of these parameters, use the ‐nozosprecheck option.  \\nUsage \\n‐nozosprecheck \\nExample \\nsetup.rexx ‐nozosprecheck \\n \\n \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n24 \\nOptimizing a SAS Software Depot \\nIf you are concerned about the size of your SAS Software Depot, you can use the ‐compressdepot \\ncommand line option in order to reduce the size of the JAR file repository by 30 to 50%. A depot that \\nhas been optimized can have additional orders added to it. An optimized depot that has had orders \\nadded to it can use the command line option again to account for the files that have been added after \\nthe initial optimization. \\nNote that you cannot create media from a depot that has been optimized. \\nUsage \\n‐compressdepot ‐console \\nNote:  SAS recommends that you use the ‐console command line with ‐compressdepot in order that \\nyou can see the progress of the optimization. The ‐console command is not supported on Microsoft \\nWindows or Microsoft Windows for x64 so those users will not see a console progress indicator. \\nExample \\nsetup.sh ‐compressdepot ‐console \\nVerifying an Optimized Depot \\nIf you optimize your depot, you may wish to verify any number of elements of that depot: \\n• \\ntotal number of files found in a depot  \\n• \\nlist of files found and their directory path(s)  \\n• \\nlist and total of the files missing from the depot and shows the paths where the missing files \\nshould be found \\n• \\nlist and total of the orders found \\n• \\nlist and total of the SAS installation data files found \\n• \\nlist of the files that are the wrong size and specifies their incorrect and correct sizes \\n• \\nlist of the files where checksums are incorrect and specifies their correct and incorrect \\nchecksums \\nThis information can be gathered by using the SAS Software Depot Check Utility described in \\n“Chapter 9 — Additional Tools” below.  \\nSpecifying Different SASUSER and WORK Directories (Windows and UNIX \\nonly) \\nSASUSER \\nSASUSER is a SAS library where users store permanent SAS data sets, catalogs, preferences, profile \\ninformation, and changes to ODS templates. By default, SASUSER is Documents\\\\My SAS \\nFiles\\\\9.4 on Windows and ~/sasuser.v94 on UNIX. If you would like to change the location \\nthat is used for SASUSER, you should use the ‐sasuser command line option. Note that the path \\nyou use in the command line option must already exist or the deployment will revert to the default \\nvalue with a warning message. \\n \\n \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n25 \\nUsage \\nsetup.exe ‐sasuser \"<existing directory path>\" \\nExamples \\nsetup.exe ‐sasuser \"C:\\\\SASFILES\\\\!USERNAME \" (Windows) \\nsetup.sh ‐sasuser \"~/sasfiles\" (UNIX) \\nNote that, for Windows, you can use the variable !USERNAME  in the directory path for a user that \\nwill be running SAS Foundation after the deployment. If you use the !USERNAME  variable, the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard will not validate the directory path, but at start-up, SAS Foundation will create \\nthe specified path and make it usable. For example, suppose you use  ‐sasuser \\nC:\\\\SASFILES\\\\!USERNAME but C:\\\\SASFILES does not exist. At start-up, SAS Foundation will \\ncreate the path C:\\\\SASFILES\\\\<user ID of the person who starts SAS Foundation>.  \\nWORK \\nWORK is the work directory where temporary processes are run. By default, WORK is \\nC:\\\\temp\\\\SAS Temporary Files on Windows and the directory that the JVM sets, usually /tmp, \\non UNIX. If you would like to change the location that is used for WORK, you should use the ‐work \\ncommand line option. Note that the path you use in the command line option must already exist or \\nthe deployment will revert to the default value with a warning message. \\nUsage \\nsetup.exe ‐work \"<existing directory path>\" \\nExamples \\nsetup.exe ‐work \"C:\\\\SASWORK\\\\!USERNAME \" (Windows) \\nsetup.sh ‐work \"~/saswork\" (UNIX) \\nNote that, for Windows, you can use the variable !USERNAME  in the directory path for a user that \\nwill be running SAS Foundation after the deployment. If you use the !USERNAME  variable, the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard will not validate the directory path, but at start-up, SAS Foundation will create \\nthe specified path and make it usable. For example, suppose you use  ‐work \\nC:\\\\SASWORK\\\\!USERNAME but C:\\\\SASWORK does not exist. At start-up, SAS Foundation will create \\nthe path C:\\\\SASWORK\\\\<user ID of the person who starts SAS Foundation>. \\nSubsetting an Order without SAS Foundation \\nIf you choose to move or copy a depot, additional dialogs allow you to subset the orders in the depot \\nbeing considered, so that only a part is moved or copied (see “Moving Between Shared Networked \\nLocations” section above). One of the ways you can subset the order being moved is “by Foundation \\nproduct”; that is, by SAS products usually installed on a server, such as SAS/GRAPH and SAS/STAT. \\nThe ‐subsetclients command line changes that dialog so that you can subset by client products \\nthat are not configurable, such as SAS Enterprise Guide and SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. If you \\nuse the ‐subsetclients command line, the “by Foundation product” choice becomes “by \\nproduct.” Also, note that if you use this command line, only non-configurable client software will be \\nlisted in this dialog. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n26 \\nNote:  As of SAS 9.4 (TS1M1), Rev. 940_14w19, ‐subsetclients will always also include SAS \\nManagement Console. \\nUsage \\n‐subsetclients \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐subsetclients \\nSubsetting an Order with SAS Foundation \\nYou can also subset an order to include both SAS Foundation products and the non-configurable \\nclients described above by using the ‐subsetnonconfig command line. If you use the  \\n‐subsetnonconfig command line, the “by Foundation product” choice becomes “by product.”  \\nUsage \\n‐subsetnonconfig \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐subsetnonconfig \\nCreating a Report of Subsetted Products \\nIf you intend to subset an order using either command line options or the dialogs in the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard, you may also want to create a report of what products were included and \\nexcluded from the resulting subsetted order. To create this report, use the command line ‐\\nlistdepot when you start the SAS Deployment Wizard. The following is an example of what that \\nreport might look like: \\n \\nDate: 2011 Sep 25 10:02:56 \\nDepot: /SASHOME \\n \\nOrder: 099SPS \\n+ Base SAS [base__93ts1m0__mvs__ne__sp0__1] \\n+ Base SAS [base__93ts1m0__mvs__w0__sp0__1] \\n+ Base SAS Help and Documentation [basedoc__93110__prt__xx__sp0__1] \\n+ Base SAS JAR Files [basejars__93110__prt__xx__sp0__1] \\n<...> \\n \\nOrder: 099SQ2_2011-07-19-12.27.01 \\n+ Advanced Analytics Common Components [aacomp__93110__wx6__en__sp0__1] \\n+ DATA Step to DS2 Translator [accelmva__93160__wx6__en__sp0__1] \\n+ Microsoft Office Access Database Engine 2010 \\n[ace__93112__prt__xx__sp0__1] \\n- SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__de__sp0__1] \\n+ SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__en__sp0__1] \\n- SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__es__sp0__1] \\n \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n27 \\nThe Date field describes when the report was created. The Depot field describes the location where \\nthe subsetted order has been placed by the SAS Deployment Wizard. The Order field gives the order \\nnumber for the original order being subsetted. \\n \\nIn the list of products, a + symbol indicates that the product was in the original order and is included \\nin the subsetted order in the location named in the Depot field. A – symbol indicates the product was \\nincluded in the original order and has not been included in the subsetted order. \\nUsage \\n‐listdepot <location to create report>\\\\<output file name> \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐listdepot \"C:\\\\temp\\\\SASDepotList.txt\" \\nCreating an Alternate Temporary Directory \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard runs from a temporary directory that it creates and then removes upon \\ncompleting its run. If you are concerned that the temp space might be too small for the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard to run, you can use the ‐templocation command line option to specify a \\ntemporary directory of your choosing. \\nUsage \\n‐templocation <directory location> \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐templocation \"C:\\\\temp\\\\SDW\" \\n \\nNote:  When the SAS Deployment Wizard closes, it will delete the temporary directory and all its contents. \\nWhen you select a temporary directory, ensure there is nothing already in that location that you \\ncannot afford to have deleted. \\nUpdating Product Documentation \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, the SAS Deployment Wizard enables you to install only \\nnewly released documentation, such as help files. The wizard skips all SAS product maintenance \\nupdates which have occurred after your original order and installs updates to your SAS product \\ndocumentation only.  \\nNote:  While the ‐docupdate command line option became available with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, it will \\nonly be used initially with a few products and will increase in scope over the life of SAS 9.4.  \\nUsage \\n‐docupdate  \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐docupdate \\n \\nNote:  Using the ‐docupdate command line with the SAS Deployment Wizard only installs the updated \\nproduct documentation. After the installation is complete, you must run the SAS Deployment \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n28 \\nManager, selecting the Rebuild Web Applications task (see page 43) and then again using the \\nDeploy Web Applications task (see page 43).  \\nHelp with Command Lines \\nTo see a useful list of command line options that can be used with the SAS Deployment Wizard, use  \\n‐help. This command line option will open a message window describing other command line \\noptions without actually starting the SAS Deployment Wizard. \\nUsage \\n‐help \\nExample \\nsetup.exe ‐help \\n \\nPage 29 \\n \\nChapter 4 — Finding and Applying Hot Fixes \\n \\nThere are two methods for determining what hot fixes are available for your software and applying \\nthem, during the installation of your software and as a process outside of installation. This chapter is \\ndivided into sections that describe both processes. \\nApplying Hot Fixes with the Initial Installation (Prior to the Fifth Maintenance \\nRelease of SAS 9.4) \\nWhen you first install your software into a clean SASHOME, the SAS Deployment Wizard will also \\ninstall any hot fixes included in the order. Orders that are downloaded include hot fixes selected by \\nSAS as being appropriate for the SAS Deployment Wizard to install during a deployment.  \\nNote:  Orders received on media do not initially include hot fixes.  \\nFor both kinds of order delivery, download or media, when you are ready to install your software, \\nyou can refresh the hot fixes you already have and retrieve new hot fixes that are appropriate to \\ninstall with a dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard (select the Manage this SAS Software Depot \\ntask at the Select Deployment Task page, then Retrieve Hot Fixes).  \\nNote:  When you are retrieving hot fixes, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \\nIn situations where time has passed between the download and the initial installation, SAS \\nrecommends that you refresh the hot fixes using the process described in the paragraph above before \\nthat initial installation. In order to get the latest hot fixes, the SAS Deployment Wizard must have \\nInternet access.  \\nNote:  To get the latest hot fixes for an order that arrives on media, you must first create a SAS Software \\nDepot, then retrieve the hot fixes as described above. \\nHot fixes can only be installed using this method when software is first installed into a clean \\nSASHOME. After software has been installed in a SASHOME, you will have to use the method \\ndescribed below. Additional software added to a SASHOME after the initial installation will not have \\ndownloaded hot fixes installed either. \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has command line options that are specific to hot fixes, described in the \\n“Hot Fixes” section (page 17) of the “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” chapter \\nabove. \\nApplying Hot Fixes with Any Installation (After the Fifth Maintenance Release \\nof SAS 9.4) \\nWhen you install your software, the SAS Deployment Wizard will also install any hot fixes included \\nin the order. Installation includes initial installation, add-on installations, and upgrades. Orders that \\nare downloaded include hot fixes selected by SAS as being appropriate for the SAS Deployment \\nWizard to install during a deployment.  \\nNote:  Orders received on media do not initially include hot fixes.  \\nFor both kinds of order delivery, download or media, when you are ready to install your software, \\nyou can refresh the hot fixes you already have and retrieve new hot fixes that are appropriate to \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n30 \\ninstall with a dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard (select the Manage this SAS Software Depot \\ntask at the Select Deployment Task page, then Retrieve Hot Fixes).  \\nNote:  When you are retrieving hot fixes, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \\nIn situations where time has passed between the download and the initial installation, SAS \\nrecommends that you refresh the hot fixes using the process described in the paragraph above before \\nthat initial installation. In order to get the latest hot fixes, the SAS Deployment Wizard must have \\nInternet access.  \\nNote:  To get the latest hot fixes for an order that arrives on media, you must first create a SAS Software \\nDepot, then retrieve the hot fixes as described above. \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has command line options that are specific to hot fixes, described in the \\n“Hot Fixes” section (page 17) of the “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” chapter \\nabove. \\nApplying Hot Fixes after the Installation \\nFinding Applicable Hot Fixes \\nThe hot fixes that are included in your order are those that SAS feels can be safely applied with your \\ninstallation. There may be more hot fixes that should only be applied after installation is complete, or \\nafter using the software for a while, you may want to determine what new hot fixes are available for \\nyour software.  \\nSAS Technical Support has created an application, the SAS Hot Fix Analysis, Download and \\nDeployment Tool to evaluate your software deployment and generate a report that includes \\ninformation and links to hot fixes that are available for your software. The SAS Hot Fix Analysis, \\nDownload and Deployment Tool is available at \\nhttp://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/SASHFADD.html. Be sure to read the \\nusage guide, available at the same location, before downloading and using the tool. \\nApplying Hot Fixes \\nWhen you have downloaded the hot fixes you need, you should apply them to your SAS software \\nwith the SAS Deployment Manager. If you are interested in quiet installation of hot fixes, you must \\nuse the command line options described below. \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager is located in your SASHOME, in the\\\\SASDeploymentManager\\\\9.4 \\nfolder.  \\nBefore you begin, ensure that you are logged on with the same user ID that was used to install the \\nsoftware. Ensure that SAS services and processes have been halted. In addition, since you are about \\nto make changes to a working deployment, you may want to back up your installation before \\napplying the hot fixes. \\n1. Based on your operating system, perform the following step to start the SAS Deployment \\nManager: \\n• \\nWindows users should double-click sasdm.exe (if your Windows operating system is \\nWindows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008, you may have to right-click \\nsasdm.exe and select Run as administrator). \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n31 \\n• \\nUNIX users should execute sasdm.sh. \\n• \\nz/OS users should execute sasdm.rexx. In SAS 9.4, the metadata server runs only in 64-\\nbit mode, so if you are running the metadata server as a 64-bit application, you should \\nadd the ‐z64 command line option. \\n2. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \\nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your downloaded software. \\nClick OK. \\n3. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \\nApply Hot Fixes. Click Next to continue. \\n4. The Apply Hot Fixes page opens. Select whether you want to Install SAS hot fix, Configure \\nSAS hot fix, or both. In order to configure SAS hot fixes, you must either have already \\napplied configurable hot fixes or have selected Install SAS hot fix. If you select Install SAS \\nhot fix, type the location of the hot fix package that you have downloaded into the text box or \\nuse Browse to search for the hot fix package. When you have made your selection (and \\nentered the location in the text box if needed), click Start to continue. \\n5. The Checking System page opens while the SAS Deployment Manager checks for enough \\ndisk space and for locked files. If any files are listed in this window, follow the instructions \\non the page. If there are no files listed, or after any that were listed have been addressed, click \\nNext to continue. \\n6. The Review Hot Fix Updates page opens, describing the hot fixes that are about to be \\napplied. Click Next to continue. \\n7. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Select Configuration Directory/Level \\npage opens. On this page, you can choose to Select Configuration Directory from a list that \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager builds. This pane is populated with configuration directories \\nand levels that have been previously configured. Note that if a configuration directory has \\nmore than one level, it will be listed multiple times, once for each level the directory has. \\nSelect the configuration directory and level by highlighting it. \\nYou can also choose to Enter Configuration Directory and Level in order to specify the \\nconfiguration directory manually. You may either enter the location of the directory by hand \\ninto the Configuration Directory text box or click Browse to search for a directory. When \\nyou have entered the directory location, use the Configuration Level select list to specify the \\nconfiguration level you wish to work with. \\nNote:  \\nYou should perform this full set of procedures once for every configuration directory in order \\nto configure the hot fix before using the updated services. For each configuration directory \\nafter the initial one, you should select only Configure SAS hot fix in step 4. \\nWhen you have specified the location of the configuration directory and its level, click Next \\nto continue. \\n8. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Specify Connection Information page \\nopens. Enter a user ID and password for the metadata server that is being used for this \\nconfiguration directory and level. The SAS Deployment Manager will try to fill in the Host \\nand Port text boxes based on your configuration properties file. Enter the appropriate \\ninformation in the User ID and Password fields (and the Host and Port fields if necessary).  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n32 \\nWhen the information is correct, click Next to continue. \\n9. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Select Product Configurations on Which \\nto Apply Hot Fixes page opens. The table lists the configurations in the configuration \\ndirectory and level that you specified in step 7. Both the name you have given the \\nconfiguration and the SAS product it is intended for are included for ease in identification. \\nThe Configured Hot Fix column shows the latest hot fix that has been configured for the \\nproduct on that row. If the column reads “Not applicable” or “None configured”, then no hot \\nfix has been applied to the configuration. The Available Hot Fix column lists the latest hot fix \\nin the package directory (that is, available on your system) that can be applied to the \\nconfiguration. If this column lists “Not applicable”, then there is no new hot fix available on \\nyour system for the configuration in that row.  \\nNote:  If the Available Hot Fix column has a status of “Not applicable”, this does not mean that \\nthere are no hot fixes for this product available at all. Instead, it means that there are no hot \\nfixes available for this product in the hot fix directory you designated in step 4. If you think \\nyou should have a hot fix for a product and cannot find it, you should either go back to step 4 \\nand enter a different directory location or return to the hot fix download page and download \\nthe correct hot fixes. Be aware that hot fixes requiring configuration are not common, so do \\nnot be alarmed if your hot fixes do not need to be configured. \\nIf the Available Hot Fix column has a hot fix listed in it, then the Status column describes the \\ncondition of that hot fix. “Up to date” indicates that the latest hot fix has been configured. \\nYou should not configure hot fixes that are up to date again unless specifically directed to by \\nSAS Technical Support. “Ready to configure” means that there is a newer hot fix than the one \\nlisted in the Configured Hot Fix column and it can be configured by this task. \\nIndicate the product configurations you wish to work with by selecting the check box beside \\nthem. Clicking Select All forces check marks beside all the configurations in the list. Clicking \\nClear All deselects all the configurations in the list. \\nWhen you have selected the configurations you want to work with, click Next to continue. \\nNote:  If you are working with software that was released prior to SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. \\n940_15w29, and this page shows that no hot fixes have configuration available, return to step \\n4 and clear the Configure SAS hot fix option. Hot fixes that require configuration are rare, \\nso you should not be concerned if you do not have any marked on this page. \\n10. If a product configuration you selected in step 9 is a web application, the Select Web \\nApplications to Deploy for Hot Fix Configuration opens. (If you did not select a web \\napplication, go to step 12.) The page lists all web applications that you selected in step 9 with \\na check box. Select each product that you want to redeploy after the hot fix configuration is \\ncomplete. When you have made your selections, click Next to continue. \\n11. If a web application you selected in step 10 is running, the Stopping Application Server \\nWarning page opens. (If no selected web application is running, the SAS Deployment \\nManager will go to step 12.) Select the Allow the application server to stop option to permit \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager to stop the application server. If you do not select this option, \\nyou will be unable to proceed any further in this procedure. After you have selected the \\noption, click Next to continue. \\n12. The Deployment Summary page opens, listing the steps that the SAS Deployment Manager \\nis about to take. Click Start to begin performing the listed tasks. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n33 \\n13. A window opens showing that the SAS Deployment Manager is applying your hot fixes. \\nWhen the tasks are complete, click Next. \\n14. The Hot Fix Updates Complete page opens, describing what has been applied and providing \\nlogs for any hot fixes that were configured. Click Next to continue. \\n15. The Additional Resources page opens, listing links to important documentation about \\ndeploying SAS software. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Manager.  \\n16. If you configured any hot fixes, an HTML page opens that describes the location of the logs \\nand any additional manual configuration steps that are required. You should perform any \\nmanual steps that are listed before attempting to run the software that has just been updated. \\nCommand Line Options for Hot Fixes \\nThere are a number of command line options that may be used with the SAS Deployment Manager.  \\n‐reinstallhotfix \\nBy default, after the SAS Deployment Manager installs a hot fix on a machine, the deployment \\nregistry is updated to indicate the inclusion of that hot fix. On subsequent uses of the SAS \\nDeployment Manager, hot fixes are checked against the deployment registry so that previously \\ninstalled hot fixes are not reinstalled. If you want the SAS Deployment Manager to ignore that \\nhot fixes have already been installed on a machine and include them in another installation pass, \\nuse the ‐reinstallhotfix command line option. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n34 \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐reinstallhotfix \\n‐skipusercheck \\nThe hot fix installer performs a check to ensure that the user ID that performed the initial \\ndeployment is also the user ID applying the hot fixes. The ‐skipusercheck command line \\nforces the hot fix installer to skip that check so that another user ID maybe used. Note that the \\nlogged in user should have the same permissions as the user that performed the deployment, \\notherwise permission conflicts may arise. However, if permissions are set appropriately, a \\ndifferent user can update files installed under a different user ID. \\nOn UNIX, note that the ownership of the entire SAS tree must be changed to the new installer ID \\nby issuing a command such as  \\nchown ‐Rh <new_userid>:<group> <SASHOME> \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐skipusercheck \\nOn z/OS, when using UNIX System Services, the ownership of the entire SAS tree also must be \\nchanged to the new installer ID by issuing a command such as  \\nchown ‐Rh <new_userid>:<group> <SASHOME> \\nThe user ID installing the hot fix must have the authority to create new data sets with the same \\nhigh-level qualifier as the existing installation and modify the existing data sets. Also, if the  \\n‐nojubsubmit command line option (described below) is not used, the hot fix installer \\nautomatically runs the install jobs under the original installer ID, based on data (such as jobcards \\nand user ID) stored in the install.properties file. \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐skipusercheck \\n‐hotfixdir \\nBy default, the launcher script will look for the hot fixes in \\n<SASHOME>/InstallMisc/HotFixes/New. ‐hotfixdir allows you to specify a different \\ndirectory as the default location for the hot fixes. ‐hotfixdir must be followed by a directory \\npath to the hot fixes that you wish to apply. \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐hotfixdir \"C:\\\\Downloads\\\\HotFix\" \\nNote:  If you install multiple hot fixes on a z/OS machine, all hot fixes will be installed to a set of staging \\nhot fix libraries incorporating the name of the first alphanumeric value of the hot fixes. For \\nexample, if there are two hot fixes named A01 and B06, the staging name will be A01 with the \\ncontents of both A01 and B06 included in that image. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n35 \\n‐console (UNIX only) \\nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on \\nz/OS. \\nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Manager \\nin console mode, allowing you to use a headless system to install hot fixes. Console mode cannot \\nbe used on your middle tier.  If you use console mode, each dialog used in the deployment of \\nyour SAS software is represented in text. \\nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \\nquit”, you must include those symbols. \\nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output \\nof the SAS Deployment Manager. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display \\nbefore pausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a \\nline before wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with \\nany other command line option. \\nUsage \\n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \\nExample \\nsasdm.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \\n‐x11 (z/OS only) \\nBy default, z/OS machines use console mode when applying hot fixes. If you are deploying hot \\nfixes on a z/OS machine and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command line option to \\nuse the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐x11 \\n‐silenthotfix (see note below) \\nYou can suppress the user interface for installing hot fixes (steps 3 and following above) by \\nrunning in this mode. This is especially useful for enterprise-wide deployments. Note that if you \\nhave stored your hot fixes in some location other than the default \\n(<SASHOME>/InstallMisc/HotFixes/New), you should also use the ‐hotfixdir option \\ndescribed below to identify the location of the hot fixes. \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐silenthotfix \\nNote:  The ‐silenthotfix command line option will only install hot fixes. The SAS Deployment \\nManager log will indicate if a hot fix that has been installed also requires configuration. In order to \\nconfigure hot fixes silently, you must create a response file and use it with the ‐quiet option. For \\nmore information about response files and the ‐quiet command line option, see the “Record and \\nPlayback” section of “Chapter 7 — SAS Deployment Manager: Command Line Options”. \\nThe hot fix download site described in the report created by the SAS Hot Fix Analysis, Download \\nand Deployment Tool will indicate if a hot fix requires configuration. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n36 \\n‐z64 (z/OS only) \\nIf you are installing hot fixes for your 64-bit Metadata Server SAS software, sasdm.rexx must \\nbe followed with the ‐z64 command line option. \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐z64 \\nNote:  If your hot fixes are not in the default location, then you must indicate where the hot fix(es) you \\nwish to install are located by using the ‐hotfixdir command line option described above. \\n‐jobsubmit (z/OS only) \\nBy default on z/OS machines, the hot fix installer will not submit batch jobs to complete the \\napplication of your hot fixes, allowingyou to edit and submit the batch jobs yourself. If you use \\nthe ‐jobsubmit command line option, the hot fix installer will submit batch jobs to complete the \\napplication of your hot fixes. There are several reasons to not use ‐jobsubmit, including the \\nfollowing: \\n• \\nYour site uses JES3 (not JES2) \\n• \\nYour FTP server is configured for JESINTERFACELEVEL=2 \\n• \\nThe SAS installer ID is not authorized to use FTP \\n• \\nYou need to make site-specific changes to the JCL or wish to review the JCL before \\nsubmission \\n• \\nThe FTP JES interface’s requirement that the jobname be the user ID performing the \\ninstall suffixed with a single letter or digit is incompatible with your site’s jobname \\nrequirements \\nIf none of these conditions apply at your site, you can use the ‐jobsubmit command line option. \\nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M4), Rev. 940_17w08, if you use the ‐jobsubmit option, the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard will: \\n• \\nno longer prompt for the host name, user ID, and password. \\n• \\nallow you to use the ‐jobsubmit option with both JES2 and JES3. \\n• \\nuse the JES SYSOUT API (SAPI) to track the progress of each job, and in particular \\ndetermine when jobs have completed. \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐jobsubmit \\n‐hotfixupdate (z/OS only) \\nBy default, hot fixes included with an order can only be installed in a clean SASHOME. If you \\nwant to install hot fixes in orders after your original order, you should use the ‐hotfixupdate \\ncommand line option with those subsequent orders.  \\nBecause an installation that includes a metadata server on z/OS requires two passes of the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard (one for 64-bit SAS software and then a second for 31-bit SAS software), if \\nyou installed hot fixes during the 64-bit installation you should force the SAS Deployment \\nWizard to install hot fixes during the 31-bit installation into your existing SASHOME directory.      \\nUsing the ‐hotfixupdate command line option for the 31-bit install permits the 31-bit \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n37 \\ninstallation into your existing SASHOME to include the 31-bit hot fixes, thereby allowing you to \\navoid having to use the SAS Deployment Manager process for hot fixes in your order.  \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐hotfixupdate \\nAdditional Notes for z/OS \\n• \\nIf you do not use the ‐jobsubmit option, the list of hot fix jobs to execute will be written to \\nmember JOBINDEX in  <high-level-qualifier>.< hotfix id>.INSTALL.CNTL. Submit \\nthe first job in the list and the entire set of HOTFIXn jobs will run automatically (each job submits \\nthe next job in the chain).  \\nNote:  The hot fix CNTL library cannot be opened in Edit mode after submitting the jobs. Some hot fix \\njobs will need exclusive access to the CNTL library for updates. \\nThe PROMOTE job is not run as part of this sequence. It should not be submitted until you are \\nready to move the staged data sets into production. If you want to test the hot fixes before \\npromoting them to production, you can use the JCL, CLISTs, or REXX execs created in <high-\\nlevel-qualifier>.<E80002>.PROCLIB, CLIST, or SASRX, respectively. These concatenate the staged \\ndata sets before the production data sets. \\n• \\nIf the hot fix installation created \\'&prefix.<hot fix number>.LIBRARY\\' and it contains a SASHOST, \\nSASXAL, or SASXA1 module, and if you set SAS System options by assembling the DEFAULT \\nOPTIONS TABLE using the BAOPTS1 member of the original CNTL data set, then you must re-\\nassemble this table after applying your hot fixes. To re-assemble this table, perform the following \\nsteps: \\n1. Edit the BAOPTS1 member in the original CNTL data set. \\n2. Change the SYSLMOD DD in all three LINK EDIT steps to point to the new <high-level-\\nqualifier>.LIBRARY. \\n3. Rerun BAOPTS1. \\n• \\nIf the hot fix installation created a &prefix.<hot fix number>.LIBRARY and you run with \\nan entry point of SASLPA, then you will need to look in the unloaded library to see if any of the \\nnew modules are installed in your LPA. If so, then you will need to replace them with the new \\nmodules and refresh LPA. \\n• \\nIn the configuration guide, the modules recommended for installation in the LPA are \\nSASXAL \\nSABXSPL \\nSABODSL \\nSABXDML \\nSABDS \\nSABSCLL \\nSABDBGM \\nSABZPLH \\nSABXGPH \\nNote that if you use the BNDLSUFX option, you will have to rename the modules appropriately \\nin your LPA. For more information about the LPA bundled configuration and information about \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n38 \\nusing the BNDLSUFX option, refer to the \"Installing SAS 9.4 Foundation into the LPA/ELPA\" \\nsection in the Configuration Guide for SAS 9.4 Foundation for z/OS. \\nHot Fix Logs \\nA hot fix installation log is created in <SASHOME>/InstallMisc/InstallLogs/<IT_date-and-\\ntime-stamp>.log (for example, /sas94/InstallMisc/InstallLogs/IT_2011-07-19-\\n13.54.19.log). Each attempt to install a hot fix results in the creation of a new log file with detailed \\ninformation regarding the installation process. \\nIn addition, hot fix installation is recorded in the SAS Deployment Registry. The deployment registry \\nreport is described in detail in the “Additional Tools” chapter, on page 76. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 39 \\n \\nChapter 5 — SAS Deployment Wizard: Basic Troubleshooting \\nSuspending and Resuming a Deployment \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. 940_15w29, the SAS Deployment Wizard on Windows and \\nUNIX has added a feature to allow you to exit the SAS Deployment Wizard during configuration or \\ninstallation in order to remediate issues that caused a failure, and then resume where you left off \\nduring your deployment. With this new feature, a deployment that has been restarted avoids having \\nto go through dialogs again, with the exception of password dialogs. If you attempt to retry a \\npreviously suspended deployment, the SAS Deployment Wizard will ask if you want to resume your \\nprevious deployment, or start anew.  \\nThere are a few caveats to consider if you decide to take advantage of this new feature. \\n• \\nSuspend/resume is not supported on z/OS. Support for suspend/resume on z/OS will be \\nprovided in the future. \\n• \\nAll failed installation steps bypassed in the initial deployment will be rerun in the resumed \\ndeployment, and cause the post-processing step to be rerun. \\n• \\nAll configuration steps bypassed in the initial deployment will be bypassed in the resumed \\ndeployment as well. \\n• \\nThe new functionality is not intended to remediate invalid or improper dialog responses, \\nsuch as an unusable port. This feature is intended only for addressing environmental issues \\nkeeping the SAS Deployment Wizard from continuing. \\n• \\nIn order to resume a previous unfinished deployment, the same order number must be used. \\n• \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will not support suspend/resume when updating existing \\ndeployments in place (update mode). Resuming from any failure will result in the SAS \\nDeployment Wizard executing in update mode again to install and configure any remaining \\nproducts. \\nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M7), Rev. 940_20w34, the SAS Deployment Wizard does \\nsupport suspend/resume when updating existing deployments in place (update mode). \\n• \\nAll configuration steps bypassed by the user in the initial deployment will be bypassed in the \\nresumed deployment as well. \\n• \\nYou cannot resume an unfinished deployment in silent mode. Since you must choose \\nbetween resuming a failed deployment or starting again, a failed silent deployment must be \\nresumed in either interactive or console mode. \\n• \\nIf multiple users share the same local user space, you may receive a prompt to resume \\ndeployment unexpectedly due to the presence of files from another user\\'s unfinished \\ndeployment. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard Stopping without Error Message \\nWhen you are installing your software, the SAS Deployment Wizard may stop without generating an \\nerror message. Use the following list to troubleshoot this issue: \\n• \\nIf you are installing from media, are the DVDs damaged? \\nCheck the DVDs for scratches or smudges. Clean them with a soft cloth and try again. If the \\nproblem continues, copy the entire contents of the first DVD to a new empty folder on the \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n40 \\nlocal drive. If you receive errors while copying the contents of the DVD to a local folder, then \\nobtain new DVDs. If the copy works, then start the setup.exe file in the new folder or try the \\ninstallation on another machine. If the installation does not start on another machine, then \\nobtain new DVDs. \\n• \\nWas SAS software previously installed on this system?  \\nIf SAS software was previously installed, when you reinstall the software, be sure to close all \\nSAS programs. \\n• \\nIs antivirus software running? \\nClose and deactivate all antivirus software before starting your installation. \\n• \\nDoes your account have the appropriate permissions? \\nFor Windows, the installer account must have Administrator rights (user must be a local \\nadministrator on the machine and/or a member of the administrators group). For more \\ndetails, see http://support.sas.com/kb/5/055.html. \\nFor UNIX, the installer account should be the sas account. The root account should not be \\nused. \\n• \\nAre you installing from a SAS Software Depot or from the original CDs? Retry the \\ninstallation from a different media than the one from which you first attempted the \\ninstallation.  \\nProblems have been reported when users try to copy a SAS Software Depot from one \\nmachine to another. Instead of copying the depot, use the SAS Deployment Wizard to create \\na SAS Software Depot on your machine. If you have just copied the depot from one location \\nto another instead of using the SAS Deployment Wizard to install SAS, try installing from the \\noriginal SAS Software Depot. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard Log Files \\nThe SAS Deployment Wizard keeps a log of its activities, including both successful operations and \\nnotes about any failures that may occur. While the information contained in those logs is probably \\ntoo complex for a user to interpret, they are invaluable tools should you need to contact SAS \\nTechnical Support. \\nThe log files can be found, by default, in the following locations, by operating system. \\nWindows \\n%USERPROFILE%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\SAS\\\\SASDeploymentWizard\\\\ \\nor \\nC:\\\\Users\\\\<userid>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\SAS\\\\SASDeploymentWizard \\nSome files and folders are hidden by default and you may need to change your settings to view them.  \\n1. Select Organize→Folder and Search Options→View. \\n2. Select Show hidden files and folders. \\n3. Clear Hide extensions and Hide protected. \\n \\n \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n41 \\nUNIX \\n$HOME/.SASAppData/SASDeploymentWizard/   \\nor \\n~/.SASAppData of the user running the depot \\nInstallation Log Files \\nAs each component of your SAS Software installs, a separate log file is created with information \\nabout the installation of that component. These logs are different from the SAS Deployment Wizard \\nlog files, because they have more detail about each component, while the SAS Deployment Wizard \\nlog file only notes the success or failure of each component installation. If you have an installation \\nproblem and contact SAS Technical Support, they may ask you to check the installation logs for more \\ninformation. \\nThe installation logs are located at <SASHOME>\\\\InstallMisc\\\\InstallLogs. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n42 \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 43 \\n \\nChapter 6 — SAS Deployment Manager Tasks \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager is a tool that is included with each SAS software order. It allows you \\nto perform some administrative and configuration tasks. The SAS Deployment Manager is located in \\nyour SASHOME, in the \\\\SASDeploymentManager\\\\9.4 folder.  \\nBefore you begin, ensure that you are logged on with the same user ID that was used to install the \\nsoftware. Based on your operating system, perform the following step to start the SAS Deployment \\nManager: \\n• \\nWindows users should double-click sasdm.exe (depending on your settings, you may have \\nto right-click the sasadm.exe and select Run as administrator). \\n• \\nUNIX users should execute sasdm.sh. \\n• \\nz/OS users should execute sasdm.rexx. If you are using 64-bit z/OS, you should add a \\ncommand line option, ‐z64. \\nThe following sections describe the SAS Deployment Manager tasks and how to perform them. In \\nsome cases, the tasks may be associated with planned deployments, so references to the appropriate \\ndocumentation for those tasks are also listed below. \\nAdministration Tasks \\nUpdate Passwords \\nChoose this option to update passwords for selected users in an existing configuration. For more \\ninformation, refer to the “Update a Managed Password” topic in the SAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform \\nSecurity Administration Guide located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nRebuild Web Applications \\nChoose this option to rebuild web applications previously configured in an existing configuration. \\nFor more information, refer to the” Rebuilding the SAS Web Applications” topic in the SAS 9.4 \\nIntelligence Platform: Middle-Tier Administration Guide located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nDeploy Web Applications \\nChoose this option to deploy web applications previously configured in an existing configuration. \\nFor more information, refer to the “Redeploying the SAS Web Applications” topic in the SAS 9.4 \\nIntelligence Platform: Middle-Tier Administration Guide located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nRemove Existing Configuration \\nChoose this option to remove configuration content for an existing configuration. Installed products \\nwill not be removed.

After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \\nlanguage in which you want to view the SAS Deployment Manager. Click OK. \\n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \\nManage SAS File Types. Click Next to continue. \\n3. The Default Product for SAS File Types page opens. The left-hand column lists the file \\nextensions for files in your SASHOME that can be opened with more than one SAS product. \\nThe right-hand column describes what types of files use those extensions. Beneath the table is \\na list of the software installed in your SASHOME that can be selected as the default product \\nfor those file types. Select which product should become the default for the file extensions \\nthat are listed or select Advanced in order to assign a default SAS application to each file \\ntype. When you have made a selection, click Next to continue. \\n4. If you selected Advanced in step 3, the Manage SAS File Extensions page opens. If you did \\nnot select Advanced, go to step 5. \\nThe Manage SAS File Extensions page consists of a table. The left-hand column lists file \\nextensions that can be opened by more than one SAS product. The right-hand column lists \\nthe products currently assigned as the default product (SAS or third-party) for that file \\nextension.  To change the default product for a file type, use the drop-down menu to select \\nanother product.  \\nNote  \\nIf you use the Manage SAS File Types task for an extension that is currently associated with \\na third-party product to a SAS product, several things will happen: \\n• \\nThe association to the third-party product will be reset to use the chosen SAS product but the \\nchanges will take affect only for the user who is running the SAS Deployment Manager. All \\nother users will continue to see the extension associated with the third-party product. \\n• \\nThe third-party product will no longer be displayed as a selection in future invocations of the \\nSAS Deployment Manager unless the user re-associates the extension to another third party \\nproduct using Windows tools.    \\nWhile you can use this task to reset an extension currently associated with a third-party product \\nto a SAS product, the reverse is not true. You cannot use this task to reassign an extension \\nassociation from a SAS product to a third-party product. \\nWhen you have selected a default product for each file extension, click Next to continue. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n45 \\n5. The Default Product Changes Summary page opens. The first column, File Extension, lists \\nthe file extensions are being updated. The second column, Old Product, shows what \\napplication is currently the default product associated with that file type, while the third \\ncolumn, New Product, lists what you have selected as the new default product. Review your \\nselections, using Back to go back and make more changes as needed. When the page \\ndescribes the changes you want to make, click Next to continue. \\n6. The File Type Associations Complete page describes the changes that have been made. Click \\nFinish to close the SAS Deployment Manager. \\nUpdate Host Name References \\nChoose this option to update host name references in an existing configuration. For more \\ninformation, refer to the “Using the SAS Deployment Manager to Update Host Name References” \\ntopic in the SAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform: System Administration Guide located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nApply Hot Fixes \\nFor information about how to find hot fixes and install them using the SAS Deployment Manager, see \\nthe “Applying Hot Fixes” section on page 30. \\nUpdate Existing Configuration \\nChoose this option to configure SAS products that have been updated or upgraded. For more \\ninformation, refer to the “Configure Updated or Upgraded SAS Products” section of the SAS 9.4 \\nIntelligence Platform: Installation and Configuration Guide, located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nSpecify New Passphrase \\nChoose this option in order to modify the passphrase used to encrypt your passwords. This provides \\na thorough, secure, and efficient approach for an unrestricted user to address situations such as the \\nfollowing:  \\n• \\nFor greater security, you want to re-encrypt stored passwords using a passphrase as the \\nencryption key, instead of using the default fixed key.  \\n• \\nYou suspect one or more stored passwords have been compromised, so you want to re-\\nencrypt using a new passphrase.  \\n• \\nYou have upgraded the encryption type with which new or updated passwords are stored, \\nand you also want to upgrade the format of currently-stored passwords.  \\n• \\nYou are preparing to discontinue use of SAS/SECURE, so you must downgrade the format of \\ncurrently-stored passwords.  \\nCaution:  \\nWhen you introduce, change, or clear a passphrase, all passwords in login objects within the \\nspecified metadata server are affected.  \\nFor more information, refer to the “How to Re-Encrypt Stored Passwords” topic in the SAS 9.4 \\nIntelligence Platform Security Administration Guide located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n46 \\nChange Locale and Region Settings (Windows and UNIX only) \\nUse this option to change the locale and region settings for your SAS software. These settings control \\nhow SAS software displays text, numbers, currencies, and date and time values. \\n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \\nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \\n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \\nLocale Setup Manager. Click Next to continue. \\n3. The Locale Setup Manager page opens. Select the region and locale setting you wish to use \\nfrom the Language list. Then, in the lower pane, select the products you wish to apply the \\nnew settings to. You can use Select All to choose every product and Clear All to remove the \\nselection from every product. When the correct setting and products are selected, click Next \\nto continue. \\nNote:  If you have configured the machine you are working with as a Unicode server, you cannot \\nchange the default language for SAS Foundation. \\n4. The Summary page describes the changes that have been made, including the region and \\nlocale selected and the products affected. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Manager. \\nThere are a few caveats to using the tool to change the region settings: \\n• \\nIf you change your region setting so that it requires the encoding to change for SAS \\nFoundation, you will get a warning but be allowed to continue. If SAS Foundation is used as \\na server in a planned/configured deployment, you will need to create a new configuration to \\ninclude the new setting. \\n• \\nSpecifying a region setting that requires loading a different sasv9.cfg file for another \\nlanguage will change the default language for SAS Foundation. If a supporting language is \\nnot installed for the selected regional setting change, one of the following will happen. \\no \\nIf the regional setting is for a SBCS language, then English will be the default language. \\no \\nIf the regional setting is for a DBCS language, then English with DBCS will be the default \\nlanguage. \\n• \\nThe deployment registry will reflect the regional settings change only if you change the \\nregional settings for all Java products as well as SAS Foundation. \\nConfigure Autoload Directory for SAS Visual Analytics  \\nUse this option to set up autoload for SAS Visual Analytics. For more information about what \\nautoload is, see the SAS Visual Analytics: Administration Guide. \\nNote that this task can only be performed on machines that have been deployed in a specific manner. \\nThe following conditions must be met by the deployment in order for this task to be performed:  \\n• \\nthe task must be run on the machine containing the compute tier  \\n• \\nthe compute tier must have at least one application server context with a SAS Workspace \\nServer configured \\n• \\nthe compute tier is on either a Linux or Microsoft Windows for x64 machine  \\n• \\nSAS Visual Analytics High-Performance Configuration is configured in the environment \\nIf your deployment does not meet each of these criteria, do not attempt to perform this task. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n47 \\nNote:  The SAS Migration Utility will not migrate files and directories that were created using this task. The \\nmigration utility migrates the autoload metadata objects only.

The following list shows examples of the kinds of files that will be left \\nafter the uninstall tool is complete. It should not be considered the complete list. \\n• \\n<SASHOME>\\\\InstallMisc\\\\InstallLogs - contains the log files for both install and \\nuninstall. These are left behind to troubleshoot any issues with the uninstall. In some cases \\nthe install logs are just as important as the uninstall logs for determining an uninstall issue. \\n• \\n<SASHOME>\\\\ReportFontsforClients\\\\9.4\\\\SystemFonts\\\\backup - The fonts are \\nbacked up to allow a user to restore the fonts that were replaced during the install. \\n• \\n<SASHOME>\\\\deploymntreg - houses the deployment registry. \\nAlso, most DataFlux software will not be removed by the uninstall wizard and will require removal \\nusing tools from DataFlux. \\nFinally, the uninstall tool itself will remain on your system after it has completed uninstalling the rest \\nof your SAS software. For a complete removal of all SAS software, you should then delete the SAS \\nDeployment Manager directory and all of its contents from your SASHOME. Windows users should \\nalso delete the SAS Deployment Manager entry from the Start menu located at C:\\\\Users\\\\All \\nUsers\\\\SAS\\\\SAS Deployment Manager. \\nNote:  SAS 9.3 and SAS 9.4 on Windows share some components that are stored in the SAS 9.3 SASHOME. \\nIf you remove SAS 9.3 but intend to keep an existing SAS 9.4 deployment, do not remove any files \\nfrom the SAS 9.3 SASHOME manually after the SAS Deployment Manager completes its task. \\nNote:  If you uninstall Base SAS, SAS Enterprise Guide, or SAS Universal Viewer from a Windows \\nmachine, you should consider performing the Manage SAS File Types task in order to reset the default \\nproduct for any shared SAS file types. \\nQuiet Removal of SAS Software \\nA quiet uninstallation allows you to provide all of the responses that would normally be supplied to \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager when running interactively, but without the presence of a user. It is \\nintended for use in any context that does not require a user to be present at the machine.  \\nIn order to perform a quiet uninstallation, you should first create a response file according to the \\n\"Record Mode\" section of \"Record and Playback\" in “Chapter 7 — SAS Deployment Manager: \\nCommand Line Options.” After you have created a response file, you should use the information in \\nthe \"Quiet Playback Mode\" section to perform the quiet deployment on the target machine. \\nRenew SAS Software (Windows and UNIX only) \\nChoose this option in order to renew the license file for your installed SAS Foundation software.

You should not perform any of the tasks \\ndescribed below without a solid understanding of security procedures. Inappropriate changes can have \\nextremely harmful effects on not only your SAS software, but any software that you are using. \\nCertificates are used to authenticate a server process or a human user. A certificate authority (CA) is \\nan authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public keys for message \\nencryption. As part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), a CA checks with a registration authority to \\nverify information provided by the requestor of a digital certificate. If the registration authority \\nverifies the requestor\\'s information, the CA can then issue a certificate. The large collection of public \\nCA certificates (Root and Intermediate levels), for all commercial Certificate Authorities, that may be \\nused to digitally sign our customers’ private identity certificates is referred to as the Trusted CA \\nBundle. Customers may maintain their own internal Certificate Authority and may need to add their \\nCA\\'s public certificate(s) to the Trusted CA Bundle provided by SAS. \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. 940_15w29, the SAS Deployment Manager includes tools that \\nallow you to add certificates to the trusted CA bundle manually and also to remove any that you \\nhave added. Procedures to use those tools are described in the sections below. \\nThe trusted CA bundle that SAS redistributes is from Mozilla, and the list of included root CAs can \\nbe found at https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs. The trusted CA bundle is provided \\nin multiple formats, for use in different SAS \"SSL Client\" contexts.  There is a text file format, with \\nbase64 encoded contents (also known as PEM format) for use by SAS Foundation servers (for \\nexample, metadata server or Workspace Server) and identified using the SSLCALISTLOC option. It is \\nalso provided in a JKS keystore archive format for use by all SAS Java applications through a \\nkeystore file (also known as a truststore when it does not contain private key entries) called \\njssecacerts. The two SAS Deployment Manager tasks described below update both those files. \\nThese tasks must be used when your security framework includes self-signed or site-signed CA \\ncertificates or client CA certificates. Certificate management must be performed on each machine in a \\ndeployment. \\nOn Windows and UNIX, the jssecacerts file is placed into the SAS Private JRE in the \\nSASHOME\\\\SASPrivateJavaRuntimeEnvironment\\\\9.4\\\\jre\\\\lib\\\\security directory. The \\njssecacerts file is managed directly by the tasks and should not be updated or changed manually. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n64 \\nWe do not support a private JRE on z/OS, so there is no jssecacerts file on z/OS. On z/OS, SAS \\nwill create a JKS truststore, but it is only needed if you are running Java applications from USS. \\nIf you are upgrading from an earlier 9.4 release to 9.4M3, any self-signed or site-signed CA \\ncertificates that have previously been added to the SAS Private JRE’s cacerts file manually must \\nalso be added to the new trusted CA bundle using the Add Certificate task, described below. This \\nshould be repeated for each machine in the deployment. \\nAdd Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle  \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager can add certificates either individually or as a chain of trust list. In \\neither case, they must be X.509 certificates, formatted in Base-64 encoding (ASCII), with .pem, .crt, \\nor .cer extensions. For more information about creating the chain of trust list, see “Creating a CA \\nChain of Trust File” below. \\nUse the following steps to add a certificate: \\n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \\nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \\n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Manage Trusted CA Bundle, \\nselect Add Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle. Click Next to continue. \\n3. The Specify Certificate to Add page opens. Type the location of the certificate or chain of \\ntrust file you want to add to your trusted CA bundle in the text box. You can also use Browse \\nin order to search for the certificate. The Distinguished Name defined within each certificate \\nwill be used as the alias within the truststore. \\nWhen you have specified a certificate to be added, click Next to continue. \\n4. The Summary page opens, describing the action that is about to be taken. Click Start to \\ncomplete the task. \\n5. The In Progress page opens, indicating that the task has been started. When the SAS \\nDeployment Manager is finished, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Finish to exit \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager. \\nAfter the task has been completed, a log describing the actions that were taken is placed in \\n<SASHOME>\\\\InstallMisc\\\\InstallLogs, with a file name that begins with “certframe”. \\nCreating a CA Chain of Trust File \\nIf you are only adding one certificate, creating a chain of trust file is inappropriate, and you should \\njust point the SAS Deployment Manager to that certificate. If you have multiple certificates, you can \\ncopy and paste the contents of all the certificates to be trusted into a new file. These CAs can be \\nprimary, intermediate, or root certificates.  \\nTo manually create a new trust list, use the following template:  \\n(your intermediate certificate[s])  \\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \\n<base64 encoded certificate> \\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n65 \\n \\n(your root CA certificate) \\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \\n<base64 encoded certificate> \\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- \\nThe issuer of your server certificates, your intermediate CA certificate, should be the first in the file. \\nThe certificates that follow should be ordered such that the issuer of one certificate is the subject of \\nthe following one and so on until you get to the root CA certificate. The root CA certificate should be \\nthe last certificate in the file. \\nThe content of the certificate in this example is represented as <PEM encoded certificate>. The \\ncontent of each certificate is delimited with a -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END \\nCERTIFICATE----- pair. All text outside the delimiters is ignored. Therefore, you might not want \\nto use delimited lines for descriptive comments.  \\nThe file can be saved with any name, but it must have a .pem extension. \\nRemove Certificate from Trusted CA Bundle  \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager can remove certificates either individually or as a chain of trust list. In \\norder to remove customer certificates from the trusted CA bundle, you must have the permissions \\nnecessary to access the truststore location and delete the certificate file. Only certificates that have \\nbeen added with the SAS Deployment Manager Add Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle task can be \\nremoved in this way. \\nIf you remove certificates individually, you should not remove any intermediate certificates from a \\nchain of trust without either replacing them with another certificate or removing the chain entirely. \\nUse the following steps to remove a certificate: \\n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \\nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \\n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Manage Trusted CA Bundle, \\nselect Remove Certificate from Trusted CA Bundle. Click Next to continue. \\n3. The Specify Certificate to Be Removed page opens. Click on Browse in order to search for \\nthe certificate you want to delete.  \\nNote:  You cannot type the location of the certificate; you must use the Browse function. \\nWhen you have specified a certificate to be deleted, click Next to continue. \\n4. The Summary page opens, describing the action that is about to be taken. Click Start to \\ncomplete the task. \\n5. The In Progress page opens, indicating that the task has been started. When the SAS \\nDeployment Manager is finished, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Finish to exit \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager. \\nAfter the task has been completed, a log describing the actions that were taken is placed in \\n<SASHOME>\\\\InstallMisc\\\\InstallLogs, with a file name that begins with “certframe”. \\n \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n66 \\n \\n \\nPage 67 \\n \\nChapter 7 — SAS Deployment Manager: Command Line \\nOptions \\nThis chapter contains command line options that can be used with the SAS Deployment Manager, \\nincluding those required for a quiet removal of your SAS software. \\nQuiet Deployment \\nA quiet deployment allows you to provide all of the responses that would normally be supplied to \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager when running interactively, but without the presence of a user. It is \\nintended for use in any context that does not require a user to be present at the machine.  \\nIn order to perform a quiet deployment, you should first create a response file according to the \\n\"Record Mode\" section of \"Record and Playback\" below. After you have created a response file, you \\nshould use the information in the \"Quiet Playback Mode\" section below to perform the quiet \\ndeployment on the target machine. \\nNote:  These command line options cannot be used for the quiet installation of hot fixes. If you are interested \\nin quietly installing hot fixes, refer to “Chapter 4 – Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” on page 29. \\nRecord and Playback \\nRecord and playback is a feature in the SAS Deployment Manager that is used to save dialog \\nresponses to a file and then load those responses at a later point. The SAS Deployment Manager \\nprovides three different modes for record and playback. Each mode is described in detail below. \\nNote that when using playback, the SAS Deployment Wizard should be at the same level of \\nconfiguration prompting as was used in record mode. Manual revision of the response file should be \\nattempted only with extreme caution by users with experience with SAS configuration or with the \\nassistance of a SAS consultant or Technical Support. \\nRecord Mode \\nNote:  The response file generated with ‐record may contain passwords in plain or encrypted format. You \\nshould secure the response file as you would any other sensitive information. \\nRunning the SAS Deployment Manager in record mode will cause it to create a response file that \\ncontains values for each of the prompts the user sees when running the SAS Deployment Manager. \\nThe SAS Deployment Manager must run to completion when creating the response file in this mode. \\nUsage \\n‐record \\nThe response file will be created in the user’s home directory on all platforms with a file name of \\nsdwresponse.properties. \\nThe response file location can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n68 \\nNote:  If you specify a file location where a file already exists, the pre-existing file will be overwritten by the \\nSAS Deployment Manager. \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐record ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nBy default, no deployment occurs when running in a record mode. In order to force a deployment \\nwhile recording, use –deploy. \\nNote:  If you use any other command line options while using record and playback, those options are not \\nincluded in the response file. To properly use the response file, you must repeat those same command \\nline options with the playback. \\nQuiet Playback Mode \\nUsers can suppress the user interface for the SAS Deployment Manager by running in this mode. The \\nmode requires an existing response file. If the SAS Deployment Manager encounters a dialog for \\nwhich there is not a valid response in the response file, a message will be recorded in the log file and \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager will return an error code of -1. There is no visual feedback while the \\nSAS Deployment Manager is running in this mode. SAS recommends that you check your log file \\nafter the deployment to determine if any errors occurred. \\nNote:  This command line option cannot be used for the quiet installation of hot fixes. If you are interested in \\nquietly installing hot fixes, refer to “Chapter 4 – Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” on page 29. \\nUsage \\n‐quiet \\nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user’s home directory on all platforms \\nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties. \\nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\n \\nNote: \\nBecause the response file created automatically by the SAS Deployment Wizard does not contain \\nvalues for the passwords, SAS strongly recommends using the ‐quiet command line option only \\nwith a response file that has been created using the ‐responsefile command line option described \\nabove. \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nNote on Windows Usage \\nWindows users also have the –wait option available for their use. The -wait option forces the \\nsasdm.exe process to remain in the task list until the SAS Deployment Manager completes. The \\nfollowing is an example using the –wait option: \\nsasdm.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n69 \\nPartial Prompting \\nWhen running the SAS Deployment Manager in partial prompt mode, the user only sees dialogs that \\ndo not have a valid response in the response file. This mode is used when the SAS Deployment \\nManager resumes after being interrupted by a reboot and values originally supplied are no longer \\nvalid. This can occur when mapped drives are lost after rebooting on Windows. This mode may also \\nbe used by administrators to supply some of the deployment information for their users.  \\nUsage  \\nsasdm.exe ‐partialprompt  \\nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user\\'s home directory on all platforms \\nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties.  \\nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument:  \\n‐responsefile <full path to the response file>  \\nExample  \\nsasdm.exe ‐partialprompt ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\"  \\nMonitoring the SAS Deployment Manager During Quiet Playback \\nRunning the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode makes it more difficult to monitor the \\ndeployment and to notice if errors occur. To address this concern, you can use the Task Manager on \\nWindows and periodically issue the ps command on UNIX to track whether the SAS Deployment \\nManager is running. \\nOn Windows, specify the -wait option when invoking the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode \\nto cause sasdm.exe to display and remain in the Windows Task Manager process list. \\nFor example: \\nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐wait ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nIf you do not use -wait, monitor the process named java.exe. \\nNote:  Use of network management software (such as SCCM or Tivoli) might require you to use the -wait \\noption when running the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode in order for such software to \\ndetermine when the SAS Deployment Manager finishes executing. Refer to your network management \\nplatform documentation for more information.  \\nAs with most processes on UNIX, issue the ps command to monitor the SAS Deployment Manager \\nrunning in quiet mode. Remember that output from a ps command can be misleading because the \\nprocess name returned is not always named sasdm.sh, since the actual script that the SAS \\nDeployment Manager is running at any given time varies. However, the process ID remains the \\nsame. \\nInteractive Playback Mode \\nThe response file can also be used to default all the prompts in the SAS Deployment Manager. In this \\nmode, all the dialogs in the SAS Deployment Manager are displayed and the default values are \\nloaded from the response file. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n70 \\nNote:  Even if you are using ‐responsefile to deploy your software on a UNIX system, you must still \\ndeploy a windowing environment, such as X11. Using ‐responsefile still invokes a graphical \\nuser interface.  \\nUsage \\n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐responsefile \"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nUninstall All Products \\nIf you want to quietly remove all of your SAS products from your machine, you can use the ‐\\nuninstallall command line with the –quiet command line. Used together, these command lines \\nallow you to automate the software removal process without having to create a response file. \\nUsage \\n‐quiet ‐uninstallall  \\nExample \\nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐uninstallall  \\nMiscellaneous Command Line Options \\nConfiguring a Host Name \\nNote: This SAS Deployment Manager option is new with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_20w26. \\nIf you are performing an update or upgrade, the SAS Deployment Manager must be run on the same \\nhost that the original configuration was performed on. Over time, that host name might be changed, \\nresulting in errors when an update is attempted. Using the -confighostname option allows you to \\nchange the local host name that the SAS Deployment Manager validates against to the value in the \\noption. \\nUsage \\n‐confighostname <host name> \\nExample \\n./sasdm.sh ‐confighostname hostname.companyname.com \\nUsing a Text-Based Interface (UNIX only) \\nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on z/OS. \\nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Manager in \\nconsole mode, allowing you to use a headless system to configure your server. If you use console \\nmode, each dialog used in the deployment of your SAS software is represented in text. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n71 \\nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \\nquit”, you must include those symbols. \\nThe ‐console command line option can be used with other options at the same time, such as \\nrecording or playing back a response file. \\nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output of \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display before \\npausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a line \\nbefore wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with any \\nother command line option. \\nUsage \\n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \\nExample \\nsasdm.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \\nSpecifying a Graphic Interface (z/OS only) \\nBy default, the SAS Deployment Manager  uses console mode when running on a z/OS machine. If \\nyou are deploying your software on z/OS and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command \\nline option to use the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \\nUsage \\n‐x11 \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐x11 \\nAutomatically submitting jobs (z/OS only) \\nBy default, z/OS users must manually submit jobs. The ‐jobsubmit command line option allows \\nthe SAS Deployment Manager to automatically submit jobs. \\nUsage \\n‐jobsubmit \\nExample \\nsasdm.rexx ‐jobsubmit \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n72 \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 73 \\n \\nChapter 8 — SAS Deployment Agent \\nOverview \\nThe SAS Deployment Agent works with metadata servers and therefore is only used in planned \\ndeployments.  \\nThe SAS Deployment Agent is a new tool in SAS 9.4 used to support configuration operations \\nassociated with multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. The agent also \\nfacilitates synchronizing backup and restore operations for server and middle-tier machines.  SAS \\nproducts can communicate with the SAS Deployment Agent in order to run remote processes and \\ncopy content over the SAS Deployment Agent connection to perform configuration management \\noperations.  \\nIf the agent is not used, you will be required to manually perform complex and time-consuming \\nconfiguration steps for multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. In addition, you \\nwill not be able to use the SAS Deployment Backup and Recovery tool for your deployment. Instead, \\nyou will need to use operating system commands or third-party tools to back up and restore \\nresources such as the SAS Content Server, the SAS Web Infrastructure Platform Database Server \\ndatabases, and configuration files for compute servers. (You could still use the metadata server \\nbackup facility to back up the metadata server, since that facility does not depend on the SAS \\nDeployment Agent. For more information, see “Best Practices for Backing Up and Restoring Your \\nSAS Content” in the SAS Intelligence Platform: System Administration Guide.) \\nUsing the SAS Deployment Agent is not required. If you review the security considerations below \\nand decide that you do not want to use the SAS Deployment Agent, there are a number of \\ndeployment and configuration tasks that will have to be performed manually: \\n• \\nconfiguring SAS Web Infrastructure Platform \\n• \\nconfiguring a SAS Web Application Server cluster \\n• \\nstarting SAS Web Application Server and SAS Web Application Server clusters \\n• \\nchanging passwords on SAS Web Application Server and SAS Web Application Server \\nclusters \\nSecurity Considerations \\nThe SAS Deployment Agent and SAS Remote Deployment Agent Client take advantage of the Java \\nSecure Socket Extension (JSSE), enabling secure Internet communications. JSSE provides a framework \\nand an implementation for a Java version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and includes \\nfunctionality for data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client \\nauthentication. Using JSSE provides for the secure passage of data between a client and a server by \\nusing keystores and truststores in order to authenticate incoming and outgoing messages.  \\nDuring installation of the SAS Deployment Agent and SAS Remote Deployment Agent Client, you \\nhave several options for defining how you wish to secure your communication: \\n• \\nDo not secure the connection should be used if you feel that a keystore and truststore are not \\nrequired. You can always reconfigure the security at a later time by using the SAS \\nDeployment Agent configuration tasks described below. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n74 \\n• \\nGenerate the credentials to secure the connection gives SAS permission to manage your \\ncredentials by creating a keystore and truststore for you. The generated credentials will be \\nself-signed certificates and will use the name and site number from your SAS installation \\ndata file (SID file) used to license your software. The generated certificates are valid for 100 \\nyears. New credentials can also be regenerated using the SAS Deployment Agent \\nconfiguration tasks described in the “Manage SAS Deployment Agent Service” section of \\n“Chapter 6 - SAS Deployment Manager Tasks”. \\n• \\nSpecify existing credentials to secure the connection allows you to use a keystore and \\ntruststore that you have created using other Java tools. Note that SAS supports only the JKS \\nformat for the keystore and truststore. \\nAdding Services to the SAS Deployment Agent (UNIX only) \\nIf the SAS Deployment Agent is installed on a Windows machine, it has services to start, stop, restart, \\nand display the status of the SAS Deployment Agent. In order to have the same functionality on \\nUNIX, you must add a script to the machine’s system configuration. Use the following procedure to \\ncorrectly place the script.   \\n1. These steps should only be performed by a user ID with root level permissions. Ensure that \\nyour user ID has those permissions. \\n2. Go to the SASHome/SASDeploymentAgent/9.4 directory.  \\n3. Open the sas.deployd script and follow the operating system-specific instructions within \\nthe comments at the beginning of the script. \\n4. When those instructions have been completed, use the following command to start the \\nservice: \\nservice sas.deployd start \\nThe stop, status, and restart commands are also supported. \\nChecking the Status of the SAS Deployment Agent (UNIX only) \\nAnother method for determining the status of the agent on UNIX machines is to issue the following \\ncommand on the machine where the agent is running: \\nagentadmin.sh stat up\\n \\nPage 75 \\n \\nChapter 9 — Additional Tools \\nSAS Software Depot Check Utility \\nPrior to SAS 9.4, the SAS Software Depot Check Utility did not run on z/OS machines. However, \\nbeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, the utility will work on all supported operating \\nsystems for SAS 9.4. If you are using a deployment from before SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, \\nyou will still have the previous version of the utility. For information about its operation, refer to \\nAppendix D. \\nNote:  In order to determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \\nThe SAS Software Depot Check Utility works on depots that have not been optimized as well as \\ndepots that have been optimized using the ‐compressdepot command line. The utility scans a \\ndepot for the following information and then provides them in a report: \\n• \\ntotal number of files found in a depot  \\n• \\nlist of files found and their directory path(s)  \\n• \\nlist and total of the files missing from the depot and the paths where the missing files should \\nbe found \\n• \\nlist and total of the orders found \\n• \\nlist and total of the SAS installation data files found \\n• \\nlist of the files that are the wrong size and their incorrect and correct sizes \\n• \\nlist of the files where checksums are incorrect and their correct and incorrect checksums \\nFollow these steps in order to use the SAS Software Depot Check Utility. \\nNote:  You must execute the SAS Software Depot Checker using the user ID that created the SAS software \\ndepot. \\n1. Start the utility by using either of the following two methods: \\nSAS Depot Check Utility executable \\nYour SAS Software Depot contains an executable that will start the SAS Depot Check Utility. \\nGo to the \\\\utilities\\\\depotchecker directory and execute the SASDepotCheck.XXX \\nfile that is appropriate for the operating system that you are using. \\n \\nCommand line option \\nIssue the SAS Deployment Wizard setup executable command with the ‐depotchecker \\ncommand line option. For example, on UNIX, the command would be \\nsetup.sh ‐depotchecker \\nOn z/OS, the command would be \\nsetup.rexx ‐depotchecker \\n \\nNote:  For z/OS, you must execute the SAS Software Depot Checker from OMVS or a PUTTY or \\nrlogin session. You cannot execute the utility from the ishell. \\nIf you use the command line option, remember that the same restrictions described earlier in \\nthis document still apply. Also remember that the other SAS Deployment Wizard command \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n76 \\nline options may also be used, such as the ‐x11 command line option to use the graphic user \\ninterface on z/OS and ‐console on UNIX. \\n2.

When the correct \\nlocation is in the text box, click Next. \\n3. The Final Review page opens. Verify the location for the SAS Software Depot is correct, and \\nthen click Start. \\n4. The SAS Depot Check Utility page opens. As the utility runs, its results are displayed in the \\npane on the page. You can temporarily halt the report at any time by clicking Stop. If you \\nhalt the utility, it can only be restarted by restarting the utility itself. \\n5. When the utility has been halted or has completed its scan, you can review and print the \\nutility’s report in one of three ways: \\n• \\nClick Save Report to open a Save dialog in which you can save a copy of the report. \\n• \\nClick View in Browser to open the report in the default browser for the machine you \\nare running the utility on. \\n• \\nClick Print Report to open a Print dialog. \\nWhen you have completed the tasks you wish to perform with the utility report, click Finish to close \\nthe utility. \\nView Registry \\nFor SAS 9.4, the installation of hot fixes is logged in the SAS Deployment Registry. A reporting utility \\nnamed View Registry (sas.tools.viewregistry.jar) processes the deployment registry and \\ngenerates a report named DeploymentRegistry.html. The deployment registry report identifies \\nall SAS 9.4 software that is installed in the current SASHOME location, including hot fixes. The \\nfollowing is a sample of the output: \\n____________________ \\nHost: s64 \\nProduct Code: base \\nVersion: 9.4 \\nDisplay Name: Base SAS \\nDisplay Version: 9.4 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01002 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01012 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01021 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50001 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50005 \\nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50016 \\n____________________ \\nHost: s64 \\nProduct Code: stat \\nVersion: 9.4 \\nDisplay Name: SAS/STAT \\nDisplay Version: 9.4 \\n____________________ \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n77 \\nA text file version of the report, DeploymentRegistry.txt is also created. Both the HTML and .txt \\nfiles are created in the <SASHOME>/deploymntreg directory. The utility is installed by default with \\nSAS 9.4 in <SASHOME>/deploymntreg.  \\nUse the following steps to generate a deployment registry report using this utility. Note that \\nsas.tools.viewregistry.jar must be executed from the <SASHOME>/deploymntreg \\ndirectory.  \\nWindows: \\nLaunch sas.tools.viewregistry.jar (the default location is C:\\\\Program \\nFiles\\\\SASHome\\\\deploymntreg). \\nUNIX: \\nExecute the JAR file. For example: \\njava –jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar  \\nNote:  In order to run the reporting utility, Windows users must have Write permissions for the \\ndeploymntreg directory (the default location is C:\\\\Program \\nFiles\\\\SASHome\\\\deploymntreg) because the resulting reports are written to this location. \\nUNIX users must have Write permission to the SASHOME location.  \\nCommand line options: \\n-hotfix  \\nreports only the product components to which hot fixes have been applied, including the hot fix IDs. \\nNo parameter is accepted.  \\nExample: \\njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -hotfix  \\n \\n-out <parameter>  \\nspecifies an alternative output directory for DeploymentRegistry.html and \\nDeploymentRegistry.txt. This option should be used if you do not have Write access to \\nSASHOME, which is the default output location.  \\nExample: \\njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -out /u/myuserid/output  \\n \\n-all  \\n(valid beginning with SAS 9.4 M3) reports all product components that have been installed, which \\nmay include multiple releases of a product component that has been upgraded. No parameter is \\naccepted.  \\nExample: \\njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -all \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n78 \\nSAS Update File Cleanup Utility (Windows and UNIX only) \\nAs the SAS Deployment Wizard performs updates to an existing deployment, it creates backup files \\nto be used should you need to roll back the updates. However, once you are confident that the \\nupdates will not need removal, SAS has provided a tool to remove the backup files and free up space. \\nThe following instructions describe how to invoke and use the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility. The \\nSAS Update File Cleanup Utility is only available for Windows and UNIX users. \\n1. In the course of installing updates, the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility is placed in your \\nSASHOME, at <SASHOME>\\\\InstallMisc\\\\9.4. Windows users should double-click \\ncleanup.exe at that location, and UNIX users should start cleanup.sh. \\n2. The SAS Update File Cleanup Utility opens, listing the SASHOME that will be cleaned up. \\nThe utility can only be used in the SASHOME where it is located, so if you want to clean up \\nSASHOME on different machines, you must use the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility placed \\non each machine when an update was performed on it. \\n3. Note that any files that are removed by the utility cannot be recovered. If you accept this \\ncondition, click Remove Backup Files to start the utility. The Results pane will show where \\nthe utility is scanning, what files are being deleted, and how much space is being cleared. \\n4. When the utility finishes running, click Close to close the utility. \\n \\n \\nPage 79 \\n \\nAppendix A — Independent Installation of SAS Products \\nOverview \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4, some SAS products will be delivered in two formats: the first is the standard \\nformat to be installed by the SAS Deployment Wizard, and the second is an independent format that \\ndoes not require using the SAS Deployment Wizard. This second format is much smaller, thereby \\nmaking it easier to install over a distributed deployment, especially using provisioning tools such as \\nMicrosoft’s SCCM. The three products to take advantage of the smaller format are SAS Enterprise \\nGuide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, and SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Microsoft Office (a \\nsubset of SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office used to open SAS Visual Analytics reports). These products \\nare only available on Windows. \\nUsers of SAS Viya can take advantage of the same format for these products to deploy them \\nindependently on Windows machines separate from their SAS Viya deployments. \\nWARNING for SAS 9.4 users:     \\nIf you are working from a software order that is older than SAS 9.4 (TS1M1), Rev. 940_13w51, \\nthe independent installation format is intended for a user to easily distribute ONLY SAS \\nEnterprise Guide and/or SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office to client machines. If you intend to \\ninstall other SAS 9.4 software or already have other SAS 9.4 software installed on the machine, \\nthen you MUST use the SAS Deployment Wizard to install these products. Installing the \\nindependent installation formats on machines with software older than SAS 9.4 is permitted.  \\nBeginning with the SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41 version of the software, the \\nindependent versions of the software can be included in any SAS 9.4 SASHOME. \\nTo determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \\nInstallation \\nFor SAS 9.4 customers, the smaller versions of these products are only available with enterprise \\nserver environment orders that already included SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft \\nOffice, or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Office. If you have any of these products in your order, the \\ncorresponding executable files are in the standalone_installs directory at the top level of your \\nSAS Software Depot with the file names described below. The standalone_installs directory \\nwill not be available if the order is for workstation environments. \\nNote:  The standalone_installs directory is only available in software depots that have been created \\nusing a full order. If you subset your software order in any way, the resulting software depot will not \\ncontain the standalone_installs directory. \\nFor SAS Viya customers, the standalone_installs directory is available after you perform the \\nsteps described in your Software Order Email (SOE). \\nThese are the file names for the independent installers: \\n• \\nSASAddInForMicrosoftOffice<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Add-in for \\nMicrosoft Office for the version number used in the file name, (such as “71” for version 7.1) \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n80 \\n• \\nVisualAnalyticsAddInForOffice<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Add-in \\nfor Microsoft Office for Visual Analytics for the version number used in the file name \\nNote: Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25, the independent install for Visual \\nAnalytics Add-in for Office is included with SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. To install \\nVisual Analytics Add-in for Office, you should follow the instructions to deploy SAS Add-in \\nfor Microsoft Office. \\n• \\nSASEnterpriseGuide<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Enterprise Guide for \\nthe version number used in the file name \\nNote for SAS 9.4 users:   \\nIf you expect to find the executable for an independent version of SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office and \\ndo not, it is likely that you do not have the full SAS add-in product. For some product combinations, \\nSAS provides an add-in that works only with Microsoft Excel. There is no independent install \\navailable for the Microsoft Excel-only version of the add-in. If you want the full SAS add-in product, \\nincluding the independent version of the SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, you should contact your \\nSAS Site Representative who in turn will need to contact their SAS Sales Representative or the SAS \\nContracts department. \\nIf you are installing to a system that has a previous version of an independent product already \\ninstalled, the executables will update the product to the version used in the name of the file. \\nIn addition, all the Microsoft requirements for the installation of the products are included except for \\nthe Microsoft .NET Framework, which has been excluded due its size. If you intend to use the \\nindependent version of the installers, you should install the version of Microsoft .NET appropriate \\nfor the version of the independent installer on your machine. \\nVersion of independent \\ninstaller \\nRequired version of \\nMicrosoft .NET \\n6.1, 6.1M1, 6.1M2 \\n4.0 \\n7.1, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13, \\n7.14, 7.15, 8.0 \\n4.5.1 or later version in \\nthe .NET 4.x family \\n8.1, 8.2 \\n4.7.1 or later version in \\nthe .NET 4.x family \\n8.3 \\n4.8 or later version in \\nthe .NET 4.x family \\n \\nUse the following steps to install your independent package: \\nNote:  SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office and SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Office cannot be installed in \\nthe same machine. \\n1. In the SAS Software Depot you created following the instructions from your SOE, select the \\npackage you wish to install. Double-click the executable file for the package you have \\nselected. \\nNote:  If you wish to install both SAS Enterprise Guide and one of the other independent products, \\nyou must go through this procedure twice, once for each product. \\n2. The Ready to Install page opens. Click Install to continue. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n81 \\n3. The Initializing and Installing page opens, indicating that files are being moved to a \\ntemporary space. When the files have been moved, the Choose Language page opens. Select \\nthe language in which you want to install from the list, and then click OK to continue. \\n4. The Specify SAS Home page opens. Enter the location where you want to install the \\nsoftware in the text box or use Browse to search for a location. Do not select a SASHome \\nlocation that contains a SAS Software Depot. When you have entered a location, click Next to \\ncontinue. \\nNote: \\n If you install 32-bit SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, or SAS Visual \\nAnalytics Add-In for Office on a 64-bit Windows OS and select a destination location in \\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\, the application will be installed in  \\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\ instead (with no other path changes).  The MSI technology \\nused to install these applications enforces the recommended standard of installing 32-bit \\napplications in the 32-bit Program Files location, C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\. \\n5. If you are installing SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for \\nOffice and you do not have Microsoft Office installed on the machine, the Select SAS Add-in \\nfor Microsoft Office Mode page opens. Use this page to specify whether you wish to install \\nSAS Add-in for Microsoft Office in 32-bit compatibility mode or 64-bit native mode. Your \\nselection should be based on the “bitness” of Microsoft Office that you intend to install and \\nnot on the operating system. When you have made your selection, click Next to continue.  \\n6. The Select Language Support page opens. Specify the languages you want to install with \\nyour product. You can use Select All to choose all of the languages or Clear All to remove \\nthe selection from all of the languages except English. When you have made your choices, \\nclick Next to continue. \\n7. If you are installing SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for \\nOffice, the Select Microsoft Office Applications page opens. Select each Microsoft Office \\nproduct that that will activate the SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. When your selection is \\ncomplete, click Next to continue. \\n8. The Checking System page opens as the installer ensures that the machine has the resources \\nnecessary for the package you are working with. After it has finished its check, either click \\nNext to continue, or Back to make changes in your selections. \\nNote that the independent installer includes all the third-party software you need from \\nMicrosoft to install and run your software, except Microsoft .NET Framework. During the \\nsystem check, if the installer determines that you either do not have Microsoft .NET \\nFramework or have an insufficient version of it, a warning message will open. If you get this \\nwarning message, you should exit the installation, download and install the appropriate \\nversion of Microsoft .NET Framework, and then restart the installation at step 1 above. \\n9. The Deployment Summary page opens, listing what is about to be installed on your \\nmachine. Note that there are more products than just SAS Enterprise Guide or SAS Add-in \\nfor Microsoft Office because the installation also includes other SAS software required for the \\nsuccessful installation and use of your package. Click Start to continue. \\n10. A progress page opens, indicating success or failure for each product being installed. When \\nthe installation is complete, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Next to continue. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n82 \\n11. The Additional Resources page opens, listing documentation and web sites that might be \\nuseful to your deployment. When you are ready, click Finish to close the installer. \\n12. The Completed X Installation page opens, where X is the name of the product you just \\ninstalled. Click Finish to close the Microsoft installation wrapper. \\nWhen the installer closes, it removes all the files that had been placed in temporary space, leaving a \\nfootprint only in the location where the software has been installed. \\nCommand Line Options \\nIndependent Record Usage \\nX.exe ‐‐ ‐record ‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \\nX represents the appropriate independent installer executable file for your package. IMPORTANT: \\nThe command line includes two dashes followed by ‐record with a space between them.  \\nIndependent Record Example \\nSASEnterpriseGuide61_x64.exe ‐‐ ‐record ‐responsefile \\n\"C:\\\\sdwresponse.properties\" \\nQuiet Independent Install Usage \\nX.exe /verysilent [‐‐ ‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\"] \\nX represents the appropriate independent installer executable file for your package.

This \\nuninstallation topic describes the method to remove the independent products for releases before \\nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and for SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and after. \\nNote:  To determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \\nBefore SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 \\nNormal Mode \\nTo remove the independent products from a machine, use Uninstall a program in the Windows \\nControl Panel. When the list of software to uninstall is created, there will be an entry for each \\nindependent product for every language that you originally installed in. For example, if you install \\nSAS Enterprise Guide in English and French, you will have to uninstall both the English and French \\nversions with the Control Panel. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n83 \\nAfter the Control Panel has completed its task, artifacts from the installation will remain in the \\ninstallation directory. These are no longer needed and can be safely removed manually. In addition, \\nsoftware (such as SAS Integration Technologies Client and SAS Providers for OLE DB) that is \\nrequired for the product you’ve uninstalled will remain in your SAS Home. Before manually \\nremoving these shared components, ensure that all other SAS software is uninstalled since these \\ncomponents may be required for software that remains on the machine. \\nQuiet Mode \\nThe products described in this section can also be uninstalled in quiet mode by invoking the \\nMicrosoft installation wrapper with command line options.  \\nUsage \\nmsiexec.exe /qn /x {<product GUID>} \\nNote that there is a specific product GUID to be used for every combination of product and language. \\nUse of the wrong product code will result in the failure of the uninstallation. The command must be \\nused for each product and language combination that you want to remove. \\nNote also that the curly brackets should be included in the command around the product GUID. In \\norder to find the appropriate product GUID, you should look in the registry under the following \\nproduct registry keys. \\n• \\nSAS Enterprise Guide: \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\Enterprise Guide\\\\6.1 \\n• \\nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (64-bit software on a 64-bit machine) : \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\AddIn for Microsoft Office\\\\6.1 \\n• \\nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (32-bit software on a 64-bit machine): \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\AddIn for \\nMicrosoft Office\\\\6.1 \\n• \\nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (32-bit software on a 32-bit machine): \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\AddIn for Microsoft Office\\\\6.1 \\nThe languages are installed under the products registry key in a LanguageResources folder which \\ncontains an entry for each language code. So for example, if SAS Enterprise Guide is installed with \\nItalian and Russian resources, the following keys will exist: \\n• \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\Enterprise \\nGuide\\\\6.1\\\\LanguageResources\\\\IT \\n• \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\SAS Institute Inc.\\\\Enterprise \\nGuide\\\\6.1\\\\LanguageResources\\\\RU \\nAll of the above registry keys will have a ProductId value inside them which contains the product \\nGUID. The following table lists the language codes and their identifiers. \\n \\nCode \\nLanguage Resource \\nAR \\nArabic resources \\nDA \\nDanish resources \\nDE \\nGerman resources \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n84 \\nES \\nSpanish resources \\nFR \\nFrench resources \\nHE \\nHebrew resources \\nHU \\nHungarian resources \\nIT \\nItalian resources \\nJA \\nJapanese resources \\nKO \\nKorean resources \\nNL \\nDutch resources \\nPL \\nPolish resources \\nRU \\nRussian resources \\nSV \\nSwedish resources \\nTR \\nTurkish resources \\nzh-CN \\nChinese (simplified) Resources \\nzh-HK \\nChinese (traditional, Hong Kong) resources \\nzh-TW \\nChinese (traditional, Taiwan) resources \\n \\nExample \\nmsiexec.exe /qn /x {604F30E1-35F2-4E34-AA21-3E83CDE863E1} \\nThis command will uninstall SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 in English. \\nAfter the uninstall is completed, artifacts from the installation will remain in the installation \\ndirectory. These are no longer needed and can be safely removed manually. In addition, software \\n(such as SAS Integration Technologies Client and SAS Providers for OLE DB) that is required for the \\nproduct you’ve uninstalled will remain in your SAS Home. Before manually removing these shared \\ncomponents, ensure that all other SAS software is uninstalled since these components may be \\nrequired for software that remains on the machine. \\nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and After (Including SAS Viya) \\nBecause the independent products include the SAS Deployment Manager, you should follow the \\ninstructions at “Uninstall SAS Software (Graphical User Interface Uninstall Tool)” on page 48 to \\nremove them from your deployment. \\nApplying Hot Fixes \\nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25, the independent products include a version of the \\nSAS Deployment Manager, thereby changing how hot fixes should be installed. This hot fix topic \\ndescribes the method to apply hot fixes for releases before SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and for \\nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and after. \\nNote:  To determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \\nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n85 \\nBefore SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 \\nThe description of this process assumes that you have already downloaded the hot fix zip files for \\nyour product from http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/hotfix.html. If you \\ndo not have the necessary zip files, go to that link and follow the instructions there to find and \\ndownload the appropriate files.  \\nThe hot fix zip file is named using the following pattern: \\n<hot fix ID number><operating system>.zip \\nwhere ID number is a unique identifier using a letter and five digits, and operating system is a \\ntwo-byte code for the Windows operating system (wn for 32-bit Windows and x6 for 64-bit \\nWindows). For example, S22001x6.zip is the zip file containing S22001 for 64-bit Windows. \\n1. Create a directory on your machine that is named using the full identifier. So, \\nS22001x6.zip, you would create a directory named S22001x6. You should create a \\ndirectory for each hot fix zip file you have downloaded. \\n2. Unzip the contents of the zip file into the directory you just created. If you have more than \\none zip file, ensure that the contents of each zip file are extracted into the appropriate \\ndirectory. \\n3. Go to the \\\\products subdirectory of the new directory. Notice that there are a number of \\ndirectories, named something like this: \\nmsofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1 \\nThe name uses the following pattern: \\n<product identifier>__<hot fix ID number>__<operating \\nsystem>__<language code>__sp0__1 \\nThe product identifier is a code to identify the product that is affected by the hot fix, \\nusually msofficeint for SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or eguide for SAS Enterprise \\nGuide. Some hot fixes are for both products and will only have one of the two product codes.  \\nThe hot fix ID number is the same that was used on the zip file. \\nThe operating system is a three-byte code with win representing 32-bit Windows and \\nwx6 representing 64-bit Windows. \\nFinally, the language code corresponds to the language the hot fix is for, according to the \\nfollowing list: \\nCode \\nLanguage  \\nde \\nGerman  \\nen \\nEnglish \\nes \\nSpanish  \\nfr \\nFrench  \\nit \\nItalian  \\nja \\nJapanese  \\nko \\nKorean  \\npl \\nPolish  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n86 \\nru \\nRussian  \\nzh \\nChinese (simplified)  \\nzX \\nChinese (traditional, Hong Kong)  \\nzt \\nChinese (traditional, Taiwan)  \\nMake note of the name of the directories for the languages for which you want to apply the \\nhot fix. \\n4. If you want to perform a standard installation (rather than a quiet installation), go to the \\ndirectory which is named after the right appropriate combination of product, operating \\nsystem, and language. In that directory, double-click on the .msp file to perform the \\ninstallation. The following in an example path to the .msp file. \\nC:\\\\S22001x6\\\\products\\\\msofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1\\\\ \\nmsofficeint_patch.msp \\nIf you want to perform a quiet installation, open a command prompt and issue the following \\ncommand in this format: \\nmsiexec.exe /update \"<path to executable file>\\\\<product \\nidentifier>.msp\" /qn /norestart \\nThe path to executable file is the full path to the language-specific directory you \\nfound in step 3. The product identifier is the same that is described in step 3. The \\nfollowing is an example of such a command, assuming that we created the S22001x6 \\ndirectory on the C: drive and we want to install the English hot fix: \\nmsiexec.exe /update \"C:\\\\S22001x6\\\\products\\\\ \\nmsofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1\\\\msofficeint_patch.msp\" /qn \\n/norestart \\n5. Repeat step 4 for each language that you have used to install the original product. \\nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and After (Including SAS Viya) \\nBecause the independent products include the SAS Deployment Manager, you should follow the \\ninstructions at “Applying Hot Fixes after the Installation” on page 30 to apply hot fixes to them and \\ntheir associated products. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 87 \\n \\nAppendix B — Windows Administration \\nPreparing for a SAS Installation in a Terminal Server Environment or Citrix \\nTo properly install SAS 9.4 on a server with Terminal Services, the following steps must be \\nperformed: \\n1. Log on as an administrator to the Terminal Server to which SAS 9.4 will be installed. \\n2. Install mode is required for installing applications on Windows Terminal Servers. There are \\ntwo ways to place the system in install mode: \\n• \\nUse the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel icon and select Install. You will be asked \\nto change the user option. Be sure to select the option that allows all users to begin with \\ncommon application settings. \\n• \\nType change user /install at a command prompt (cmd.exe). A message will \\ninform you if the install mode is set correctly. \\n3. Installation of SAS 9.4 on Terminal Servers may require system reboots. In order to minimize \\nuser interruption, have all users log off of the terminal server before installation. A remote \\nterminal session can be used to install SAS software to a Terminal Server, but it is not a \\nrecommended practice due to the potential for reboots. \\nBefore you proceed with this installation, SAS recommends that you close your anti-virus and \\nfirewall software. If you keep those types of software running, you increase the possibility that one or \\nmore reinstallations of SAS software will be necessary, since certain anti-virus and/or firewall \\nconfigurations can prevent an application from installing successfully. If you are unable to close the \\nanti-virus or firewall software, make sure that the configuration allows you to install software and to \\nupdate the registry. If your SAS installation fails and you have mandatory anti-virus or firewall \\nsoftware running, please check with your system administrator. \\nIf a reboot is required, you will have to reestablish the connection to the Terminal Server after the \\nreboot is complete and you may need to put the server back in install mode. After logging on to the \\nTerminal Server session, the set-up should restart and continue the installation. If the set-up does not \\nrestart, start the set-up and it will resume where it left off before the reboot.  \\nInstalling SAS 9.4 in a Terminal Server Environment or Citrix \\nInstalling SAS 9.4 on a server with Terminal Services is the same as installing SAS 9.4 on any server.  \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n88 \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 89 \\n \\nAppendix C — UNIX Administration \\n \\nThe following are sample mount commands for each supported UNIX system. The device names \\nlisted below are used only for example; substitute your actual device names accordingly. These \\ninstructions assume your mount point is /mnt/dvdrom; however, you may choose another location. \\nNote:  Because of the number of variances based on the deployment of your hardware, these commands are \\nnecessarily generic. For the exact mount command you should use, contact your system administrator. \\nAIX \\n# mount -r -v cdrfs /dev/cd0 /mnt/dvdrom \\n \\nHP-UX for the Itanium Processor Family \\n# mount -F cdfs -o rr,ro /dev/dsk/c0t0d0 /mnt/dvdrom \\n \\nLinux for x64 \\n# mount -r /dev/dvd /mnt/dvdrom \\n \\nSolaris and Solaris for x64 \\n# mount -r -F hsfs /dev/dvd /mnt/dvdrom \\n \\nRemote Mounting \\nIf your DVD drive resides on another host, and is properly exported, mount the DVD using NFS by \\nissuing a command similar to the following: \\n# mount -o ro <remotehost>:/<dvd-rom-dir> /mnt/dvdrom \\nIn this example, <remotehost> refers to the machine that owns the DVD drive and  \\n<dvd-rom-dir> is the actual mount point for the DVD drive on the server.  \\nOnce the DVD is mounted, launch the executable with the following command: \\n$ /mnt/dvdrom/<executable> \\n \\n Note: When using a system with an automounter, it is common for a File Manager window to display when \\nthe media is inserted in the DVD drive. Do not invoke the executable via the File Manager since this \\nwill create a “Device busy” condition, preventing disk swapping later in the install process. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n90 \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 91 \\n \\nAppendix D — SAS Depot Checker (Old Style) \\nPrior to SAS 9.4, the SAS Software Depot Check Utility did not run on z/OS machines. However, \\nbeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, the utility will work on all supported operating \\nsystems for SAS 9.4. If you are using a deployment from before SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, \\nyou will still have the previous version of the utility, described in this appendix.

The SAS Software Depot Check Utility performs the following tasks in order to provide you \\nwith information about the files in your depot: \\n• \\ntotals the files found in a depot  \\n• \\nlists files found and their directory path(s)  \\n• \\nlists and totals the files missing from the depot and shows the paths where the missing files \\nshould be found \\n• \\nlists and totals the orders found \\n• \\nlists and totals the SAS installation data files found \\n• \\nlists the files that are the wrong size and specifies their incorrect and correct sizes \\n• \\nlists the files where checksums are incorrect and specifies their correct and incorrect \\nchecksums \\nThe SAS Software Depot Check Utility can be used to validate SAS 9.4 depots, including depots that \\ncontain subsetted orders that have been created during initial download with the SAS Download \\nManager, and depots that contain subsetted orders that have been created using the SAS Deployment \\nWizard. \\nThe following is an example of the output of the SAS Software Depot Check Utility: \\nSAS Software Depot Check Utility version X.X \\nThu 12/15/11 8:37:24 AM \\nUSERNAME=someuser \\n   \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\sid_files \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\cd.id \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\sassd.txt \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\setup.dat \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\depotsummary.html \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\order_data \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\cd.id \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\deployment.xml \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_bin.xml \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_bin.zip \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_lib.xml \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n92 \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_lib.zip \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_misc.xml \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\en_misc.zip \\nFOUND: C:\\\\SAS Software \\nDepot\\\\products\\\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\\\install.xml \\n… \\n*** 13408 Files were checked in C:\\\\SAS Software Depot \\n    \\n*** 2 Orders were found in this depot:  \\n099GN1 \\n09B4RX \\n    \\n*** 2 SID files were found in C:\\\\SAS Software Depot\\\\sid_files:  \\nSAS93_099GN1_70068130_Win_X64_Wrkstn_Srv.txt \\nSAS93_09B4RX_70068128_Win_X64_Wrkstn.txt \\n    \\n*** No files with wrong size were found in this depot.  \\n    \\n*** No files with wrong checksums were found in this depot. \\nRunning the SAS Software Depot Check Utility with a User Interface on \\nWindows \\nPerform the following steps to run the SAS Software Depot Check Utility with a user interface on a \\nWindows machine. SAS strongly recommends that the user ID that was used to download the SAS \\nSoftware Depot also be used to execute the SAS Software Depot Check Utility. \\n1. Open the utilities directory in your SAS Software Depot. \\nNote:  If you are working from a depot that was created by subsetting another depot, the \\nutilities directory will not exist. \\n2. Double-click the SASDepotCheck.exe (depending on your settings, you may have to right-\\nclick the SASDepotCheck.exe and select Run as administrator).  \\n3. The Browse for Folder dialog opens, asking you to specify the location of your SAS Software \\nDepot. You can browse to the location or enter the location directly in the Folder text box. \\nWhen you have specified the location, click OK. \\n4. The Select path and file name for results dialog opens, asking you to specify the name of the \\nresults file and where you want to create it. Browse to a location in the directory pane, then \\neither enter a file name in the File name text box or use the default. Click Save to continue. \\n5. The Verbose? dialog opens, asking you if you want the results file to list all of the files found \\nin the depot. Select Yes or No, and the SAS Software Depot Check Utility begins. \\n6. A progress window opens. The window lists the file as they are being checked and also \\nshows a progress bar. \\n7. When the SAS Software Depot Check Utility has completed its run, the results file opens. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n93 \\nRunning the SAS Software Depot Check Utility Manually for Windows and \\nUNIX \\nNote:  Like the rest of this appendix, the information in this section only applies to the SAS Software Depot \\nCheck Utility released prior to SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41. For information about the new \\nversion of the utility, refer to the “SAS Software Depot Check Utility” section of Chapter 9. \\nWindows \\nTo launch the SAS Software Depot Check Utility manually on a Windows machine, run the \\nSASDepotCheck.exe via a DOS command-line prompt using the following syntax. SAS strongly \\nrecommends that the user ID that was used to download the SAS Software Depot also be used to \\nexecute the SAS Software Depot Check Utility. \\nSASDepotCheck.exe ‐i <SAS Software Depot directory> ‐o <output file path \\nand name> ‐v  \\nThe ‐v command line is optional and should be used to see the full list of all files found in the depot. \\nIf you do not include the ‐i and  ‐o command line options, you will be queried interactively by \\ndialog box per the steps in the “Running the SAS Software Depot Check Utility with a User Interface” \\nsection above. \\nUNIX \\nTo launch the SAS Software Depot Check Utility manually on a UNIX machine, execute \\nsas_depot_check.sh using the following syntax. SAS strongly recommends that the user ID that \\nwas used to download the SAS Software Depot also be used to execute the SAS Software Depot \\nCheck Utility. \\nsas_depot_check.sh  ‐i <SAS Software Depot directory> ‐o <output file \\npath and name> ‐v  \\nThe ‐v command line is optional and should be used to see the full list of all files found in the depot. \\nIf you do not include the ‐i and  ‐o command line options, you will be given help information \\ndescribing them, with the expectation that you will execute the script again with the correct \\ncommand line information. \\nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \\n94 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSAS is the leader in business analytics software  \\nand services, and the largest independent vendor  \\nin the business intelligence market.

       "  {'content': '<think>\\nOkay, let me try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking: \"Since what year has SAS been giving customers around the world THE POWER TO KNOW?\" They provided a document that\\'s part of the SAS Deployment Wizard and Manager 9.4 User\\'s Guide.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll need to scan through the document to find any mention of the year when SAS started providing this service. The question is about the history of SAS, specifically the year they began offering their analytics solutions globally. \\n\\nLooking at the document, the main content is about deployment processes, command line options, and administrative tasks for SAS 9.4. However, the user is asking about the founding year or when they started their global service. \\n\\nI remember that the end of the document has a section about SAS being the leader in business analytics. Let me check the last page. Here\\'s the text: \"SAS is the leader in business analytics software and services, and the largest independent vendor in the business intelligence market. Through innovative solutions, SAS helps customers at more than 65,000 sites improve performance and deliver value by making better decisions faster. Since 1976 SAS has been giving customers around the world THE POWER TO KNOW.\"\\n\\nSo the answer is 1976. The document states that SAS has been providing this since 1976. Even though the document is about version 9.4, the question is about the company\\'s history, which is mentioned in the concluding paragraph. The user might have included that part to highlight SAS\\'s long-standing presence. \\n\\nI need to confirm there are no other mentions of the year elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the document, I don\\'t see any other years related to this specific claim. The key sentence is on the last page. Therefore, the correct answer is 1976.\\n</think>\\n\\nSAS has been giving customers around the world **THE POWER TO KNOW** since **1976**. This is explicitly stated in the final paragraph of the provided document:\\n\\n> \"Since 1976 SAS has been giving customers around the world THE POWER TO KNOW.\"\\n\\nThis historical reference highlights SAS\\'s long-standing role as a leader in business analytics software and services.',\n",

       "  {'content': \"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for a healthy breakfast idea. Let me think about what makes a breakfast healthy. It should be balanced, providing a mix of nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, and some carbs. Let me brainstorm some options.\\n\\nMaybe start with a classic like avocado toast. It's popular and has good fats and fiber. Adding an egg or Greek yogurt could boost the protein. Oh, and maybe some veggies on top for extra nutrients. That could work.\\n\\nAnother option could be a smoothie. Smoothies are quick and can pack a lot of nutrients. Using spinach, banana, berries, and a protein powder or Greek yogurt would be good. Maybe add some nut butter for healthy fats. That's a solid choice too.\\n\\nOatmeal is another staple. Overnight oats are convenient. Mixing oats with milk, chia seeds, and fruits. Maybe add some nuts or seeds for crunch. It's high in fiber and can be customized.\\n\\nWhat about a breakfast bowl with quinoa or another grain? Topped with fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey or nut butter. That's another balanced option.\\n\\nI should also consider dietary restrictions. Maybe mention alternatives for those who are vegan, gluten-free, etc. For example, using almond milk instead of dairy in the smoothie or choosing gluten-free oats.\\n\\nPortion sizes and preparation time might be important too. The user might be looking for something quick or something they can prep ahead. The avocado toast is quick, the overnight oats can be prepped the night before.\\n\\nIncluding a variety of options gives the user choices based on their preferences and time. Let me structure the response with a couple of options, each with ingredients and preparation steps. Also, highlight the nutritional benefits of each. Make sure to keep the tone friendly and helpful.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere’s a quick and nutritious breakfast idea that’s easy to customize:\\n\\n### **Avocado Toast with a Twist**  \\n**Ingredients:**  \\n- 1 slice whole-grain or sourdough bread (toasted)  \\n- ½ ripe avocado, mashed  \\n- 1 poached or scrambled egg (or a dollop of Greek yogurt for a vegan option)  \\n- Sprinkle of chili flakes, black pepper, and a pinch of sea salt  \\n- Optional toppings: cherry tomatoes, microgreens, or a drizzle of olive oil  \\n\\n**Why it’s healthy:**  \\n- **Whole grains** provide fiber for sustained energy.  \\n- **Avocado** adds healthy fats and potassium.  \\n- **Eggs/Greek yogurt** offer high-quality protein to keep you full.  \\n- **Spices** add flavor without extra calories.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protein-Packed Smoothie Bowl**  \\n**Ingredients:**  \\n- 1 frozen banana  \\n- ½ cup frozen berries (blueberries, strawberries, etc.)  \\n- ½ cup unsweetened almond milk (or any milk of choice)  \\n- 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (or ¼ cup Greek yogurt)  \\n- 1 tbsp chia seeds or flaxseeds  \\n- Toppings: sliced fruit, granola, nuts, or cacao nibs  \\n\\n**Blend it up**, pour into a bowl, and add toppings.  \\n\\n**Why it’s healthy:**  \\n- **Fiber and antioxidants** from fruits and seeds.  \\n- **Protein** supports muscle repair and satiety.  \\n- **Healthy fats** from seeds or nut toppings.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overnight Oats (Make-Ahead Option)**  \\n**Ingredients:**  \\n- ½ cup rolled oats  \\n- ½ cup milk (dairy or plant-based)  \\n- 1 tbsp nut butter (peanut, almond, etc.)  \\n- 1 tsp honey or maple syrup  \\n- ½ tsp chia seeds  \\n- Toppings: fresh fruit, cinnamon, or a sprinkle of granola  \\n\\n**Instructions:**  \\nMix all ingredients in a jar, refrigerate overnight, and enjoy cold or at room temperature.  \\n\\n**Why it’s healthy:**  \\n- **Slow-digesting carbs** for steady energy.  \\n- **Chia seeds** add omega-3s and fiber.  \\n- **Nut butter** provides protein and healthy fats.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me know if you’d like more ideas or adjustments for dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, low-carb)! 😊\",\n",
